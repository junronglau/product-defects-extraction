       "0  Love, love, love this moisturizer! As a woman who has been blessed with many birthdays, I like to take care of my skin. I don’t mind a few “character lines”, but I like my skin soft and well-moisturized. This rosy glow moisturizer by L’Orèal goes a step further with a light floral scent and a rosy color to replace the rosy glow our skin seems to lose over time. I use it every day from my face to my neck, and even down to my collarbone. Really brings out a youthful glow. This is a staple in my skin care regimen!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1  This moisturizer works so well with my skin.  Let me start by saying I am 37 years old and have fair sensitive skin that reacts negatively  to most beauty products.  Finding a moisturizer that works with my skin has been an expensive and disappointing process.  So I ordered this, thinking it would be more of the same.  But for me this moisturizer has been a miracle worker.  The moisturizer noticeably smoothed and toned my skin.  I saw a reduction in acne.  The best part was that several years ago I had gotten a terrible sunburn on my forehead and the skin was still discolored.  Guess what?  The rosy tone moisturizer wiped it out in a week.  Everyone’s skin is different and different products work differently for different people.  But for me, rosy tone is perfect and I’m so happy I found it.   \n",
       "2  I know.  Sounds to good to be true.  Maybe folks were just trying to be nice but I was told that I am aging backwards.  I think it is because my skin is actually more moist in addition to the light \"glitter\" that is in the cream.  I think that it makes me look like I am glowing.  It also has a really nice scent.  I will be using this from now on .  Definitely worth the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

I am 62 and this daily moisturizer has not made the fine lines and wrinkles magically disappear but they aren't any more noticeable There is a faint peony fragrance disappears that quickly but it does irritate my eye allergies for a few minutes. The formula is a thick, creamy, pleasant consistency.  I wait a few minutes before applying my foundation to let it absorb into my skin. Without makeup my skin has a rosy tint that lasts all day in those parts of my face that do not get touched during daily activities. After six weeks of daily use the jar is about 2/3rds full.

I bought the color alabaster, expecting a very light color. However, it was actually like a salmon pink, not really that fair in color and very very pink. I have since looked into the colors and see that it's supposed to be a 'cool' tone shade, I am still surprised though, because no one is this color! This is like the color that people try to cover-up when their cheeks are red. The powder itself isn't bad, it feels very soft and silky, and it arrived in one piece. However the color is just plain weird and I personally cannot use it on my face. Even just using a light amount gives my face a weird pink hue, I am very pale skinned so maybe I will use it for blush lol.</td>\n",

       "3988   A clumpy, gooey mess that dries flaky. The product is like this even on first usage. Tends to bulk up the base of lashes and does not create length or separation. Wears ok - does not smudge for the most part, and is easier to remove than some waterproofs. But overall very inferior, particularly for the price. I'd pay a little more and order a better quality product from Sephora.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "50511  So I will start out by saying that it is my own fault for not looking more into the color selection before purchasing. There are other reviews that have the same kind of problem. I bought the color alabaster, expecting a very light color. However, it was actually like a salmon pink, not really that fair in color and very very pink. I have since looked into the colors and see that it's supposed to be a 'cool' tone shade, I am still surprised though, because no one is this color! This is like the color that people try to cover-up when their cheeks are red. The powder itself isn't bad, it feels very soft and silky, and it arrived in one piece. However the color is just plain weird and I personally cannot use it on my face. Even just using a light amount gives my face a weird pink hue, I am very pale skinned so maybe I will use it for blush lol.  \n",
