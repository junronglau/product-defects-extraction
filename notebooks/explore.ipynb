       "0  Love, love, love this moisturizer! As a woman who has been blessed with many birthdays, I like to take care of my skin. I don’t mind a few “character lines”, but I like my skin soft and well-moisturized. This rosy glow moisturizer by L’Orèal goes a step further with a light floral scent and a rosy color to replace the rosy glow our skin seems to lose over time. I use it every day from my face to my neck, and even down to my collarbone. Really brings out a youthful glow. This is a staple in my skin care regimen!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1  This moisturizer works so well with my skin.  Let me start by saying I am 37 years old and have fair sensitive skin that reacts negatively  to most beauty products.  Finding a moisturizer that works with my skin has been an expensive and disappointing process.  So I ordered this, thinking it would be more of the same.  But for me this moisturizer has been a miracle worker.  The moisturizer noticeably smoothed and toned my skin.  I saw a reduction in acne.  The best part was that several years ago I had gotten a terrible sunburn on my forehead and the skin was still discolored.  Guess what?  The rosy tone moisturizer wiped it out in a week.  Everyone’s skin is different and different products work differently for different people.  But for me, rosy tone is perfect and I’m so happy I found it.   \n",
       "2  I know.  Sounds to good to be true.  Maybe folks were just trying to be nice but I was told that I am aging backwards.  I think it is because my skin is actually more moist in addition to the light \"glitter\" that is in the cream.  I think that it makes me look like I am glowing.  It also has a really nice scent.  I will be using this from now on .  Definitely worth the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

I am 62 and this daily moisturizer has not made the fine lines and wrinkles magically disappear but they aren't any more noticeable There is a faint peony fragrance disappears that quickly but it does irritate my eye allergies for a few minutes. The formula is a thick, creamy, pleasant consistency.  I wait a few minutes before applying my foundation to let it absorb into my skin. Without makeup my skin has a rosy tint that lasts all day in those parts of my face that do not get touched during daily activities. After six weeks of daily use the jar is about 2/3rds full.

It reminds me, personally, of the Garnier skin products which I also cannot tolerate the scent of. Yes, scent is personal and subjective, true enough, but if you don't like a strong, sticky, artificially sweet scent that lingers indefinitely, you  may not like this. I prefer facial products to NOT have a scent (what's the purpose?), or to quickly fade to nothing after a few minutes. No one wants to smell the product all day, nor mix scents when they mix products on the face. I tried it on my arms hoping it to be more tolerable than the face, but it's all I could smell for hours. It simply does not fade. It's so strong I ended up washing it off an hour later. I cannot speak to the effectiveness after only two uses, but I can give it some positive: it dries \"dry\" not sticky, and before application is the consistency of a light serum. The dispenser is nice, but the scent is a no-go for me even though I really wanted o like it.</td>\n",

       "73012  I paid significantly more for this in a chain drug store ($18) and had high hopes for it. I only used it 2x but simply cannot get past the scent. It reminds me, personally, of the Garnier skin products which I also cannot tolerate the scent of. Yes, scent is personal and subjective, true enough, but if you don't like a strong, sticky, artificially sweet scent that lingers indefinitely, you  may not like this. I prefer facial products to NOT have a scent (what's the purpose?), or to quickly fade to nothing after a few minutes. No one wants to smell the product all day, nor mix scents when they mix products on the face. I tried it on my arms hoping it to be more tolerable than the face, but it's all I could smell for hours. It simply does not fade. It's so strong I ended up washing it off an hour later. I cannot speak to the effectiveness after only two uses, but I can give it some positive: it dries \"dry\" not sticky, and before application is the consistency of a light serum. The dispenser is nice, but the scent is a no-go for me even though I really wanted o like it.  \n",

I exfoliate religiously and there are no dead cells on my skin, but I\"m still pale and yellowish.  So I decided to try this to perk up my coloration a bit, because I'm afraid that if I fall asleep, my grands will think I'm dead and bury me.First of all, this is not an easy product to find.  I went to five places before I found it.My experience:This is the first item I've bought in years that comes in a jar instead of a pumper bottle or tube.  So the first time my clean finger touched it, it was contaminated.  I use a coffee stirrer to scoop it out of the jar.  Don't buy products that come in jars!It's quite thick and stiff, so before applying, I rub my hands together for a few seconds to warm it up and hopefully make it more spreadable.  Doesn't work.  So I'm rubbing and pulling on my skin while applying.  Major no-no.Despite being so thick, it's not emollient enough for me.  So I'm doing a double application:  apply it, wait five minutes for it to absorb, and reapply.It's fragranced.  Booooo.It does't impart much color.  And that's what I bought it for.The price is right, compared to other toiletries, but ultimately, it's not worth it and I won't buy it again.  I don't hate it, and it's not ruining my skin, but... no thanks.The only reason I'm not pitching it out is that I'm too cheap.  So I'll use it up and that'll be it for this product.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I compared two rose tinted skin creams, putting them each on one half of my face for a about two weeks.1. Neutrogena Bright Boost Gel Cream, Brightening Face Moisturizer: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B081DJ199F2. L'Oreal Paris Face Moisturizer Age Perfect Renewal Tinted Rosy Tone Day Cream:https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01M09QQI0Note: I do not expect to see cumulative results so I am providing this review after only two weeks.  If I see any improvement from ongoing use of either product, I'll update this review.I don't buy into the face cream hype, so my expectations were low:  simply that the cream would make my face look a bit pink, would make my face feel moisturized, and that it would have a pleasant scent.I think of these rosy creams as more of a cosmetic than a skin boosting cream – something that will make a visible difference in the moment and wash off after, without any long-term impact.  However, neither creates a lasting or even temporary change in skin tone tone (I'm fair and it would definitely show).  The Neutrogena feels like a base to put makeup over because it seems to create a smooth surface.  My face didn't feel any more moisturized after use but I like how it feels a bit tight and dry to the touch.  The L’Oreal feels a bit oily throughout the day.The L'Oreal has a mild scent that smells a bit like an old lady. The Neutrogena has a mild, slightly floral scent.The L’Oreal goes on fairly thick and and absorbs into the skin faster than the Neutrogena.  It has a matte tone to it and although other reviewers comment on sparkles, I didn’t see any in my 10X magnifying mirror. The Neutrogena feels nice on the skin and has a pearly iridescence.  It's a bit on the runny side (I don’t know why it’s called a “gel”). There are tiny sparkle flecks (you can see them in a 10x magnifying mirror) which may help with the claim for \"brightness\".Overall, my skin seems a bit smoother than on the side that I used Neutrogena on.  It’s not enough to say there’s a noticeable difference between the two products.The Neutrogena marketing claims the cream boosts cell turnover by 10 times - but how do you even know that?  The L'Oreal marketing language is less extreme and more believable.The results are subjective, but I think my skin looks marginally brighter on the Neutrogena half of my face and it goes on light.  Overall, I preferred the Neutrogena to the L'Oreal product.</td>\n",

       "      <td>UPDATE: I'm dropping this down to 2 stars now that I've had it for a few weeks because it doesn't moisturize nearly as well as I need it to (or as well as my other products). I'm 46 so my skin is becoming more demanding, and this product strikes me as almost a little bit clay-like, both in scent and in the way it sits on top of my skin. Problem is I need my moisturizer to sink in deep so my skin won't tug when I smile (etc), and this one doesn't do the trick. When I finally put some of my old moisturizer on after a few weeks of this one, the difference was incredible.It's thicker than most day creams and feels almost a tiny bit clay-like as it goes on, but doesn't look too artificial or interfere with my makeup so I suppose it does no harm. It's listed as \"unscented\" (which I appreciate), and there's only the faintest bit of a clay-like scent. I appreciate that they didn't cover it up with something worse, although it's not my favorite either (I prefer relatively natural scents you get from some moisturizing oils in their natural state). But again, it doesn't work well enough for my aging skin.</td>\n",

Then it all went down hill.  By the 3rd day the \"rosy\" tone was way too pink, almost ruddy. I started to notice dryness in some places and very clogged blackheads in other places, so clogged that my skin felt rough on the surface. By the 4th day I had a lot of white heads forming and a breakout.  I read all these positive reviews and really do not know what skin type one has to have in order for this cream to work.  For what it's worth, I'm 43, I have moderately fair, combination skin, that is tending toward being more dry in the last couple years. I usually only experience hormone related breakout once a month or when using a particular product. I don't wear foundation so this cream did not \"interact\" with any other product on my skin. This product does have a scent that is stronger than I expected for a face cream, and while I didn't think it was overpowering per se, I didn't particularly like the scent either.</td>\n",

I have never been so disappointed in Amazon in the many years I've been a Prime member. I'm writing this to warn you, maybe you'll be lucky. I ordered Infallible Pro-Glow in Buff Beige. I promptly received Infallible Pro-Glow Classic Tan. Unexplainably it was in a box that read the correct foundation in the correct color. Knowing it was way too dark for me I want on line to exchange it for the correct color. There were no problems, it was as easy as an original order. That is until I looked at the confirmation order and noticed that Amazon would send Classic Tan again! This made no sense. I had originally ordered Pro-Glow Buff Beige, the old order showed Pro-Glow Buff Beige and they were going to send Pro-Glow Classic Tan? As unsavory as the thought was, I knew I had to talk to a person. Trying to reach a person at Amazon is not for the faint of heart. Nevertheless I knew that's what I had to do.The person on the phone helped me, told me I had to click the link emailed to make sure I got the right product. I thought it was correct so I ordered. I can't verify it was the correct product now, but the bottles are shaped different and I really scrutinized that order before I clicked. Today I received the correct color, but it was a different product, it was the Infallible Total Cover. I give up. Three strikes I'm out.</td>\n",

( we don't think that a different colour would have made a difference in covering up)Since it also seemed to dry the skin out, we removed another star.The wand has a sponge-type end and even though we don't use concealer directly from an applicator, we know that a lot of people do.To us, this is very unsanitary and can cause bacteria from the sponge to build up inside the tube so we removed an additional star because of the company's use of a sponge applicator.We were quite sad to not be able to give this one of our usual high star ratings .L'Oreal is one of our favourite lines and we've enjoy testing many of their incredible products for review.Even though we could only give this specific product a 2 star rating we think that there are people who would be able to use this liquid full wear product successfully.It's just a shame that we couldn't.</td>\n",

Definitely Not the same formula as the one sold in stores so I highly caution you not to purchase this item from this seller and I may all together stop buying makeup products as well as consumables from 3rd parties online after this experience and an experience I had with some treats I bought for my pups! So disappointing as I purchase so many different things from amazon since it’s so convenient and there customer service is usually pretty good!</td>\n",

NOTHING HAS MADE IT WORK!!!.First, it accumulates fast in the fine lines even after working it and setting with powder. Then, within a few hours it loses coverage and accumulates even more. And, it makes you look like you are 10 years older (I’m only 23 btw). Also, my fault this tone is too dark for me and it’s yellowy (oposite to the description “neutral with pink undertones”) so, it looks greenish under my eye area..The finish of this concealer is matte and “full” coverage. It’s thicker than expected but not too bad. It’s supposed to be waterproof, fade and transfer resistant 🧐.This broke my heart, because I bought this full price and it is the most expensive item in my makeup bag and I will probably end up trashing it. However, I might use it to cover pimples since this looks like it’s going to be a good fit for that...BENEFITS:✅ Matte.✅ “Full Coverage”.✅ Wears up to “24H”.✅ Waterproof and fade resistant.✅ Huge applicator and bottle.CONS:❌ It gets in every fine line you’ve got.❌ The coverage fades within hours.❌ Looks greenish in me.❌ The price killed me by comparison to other drugstore concealers.❌ If too much is applied is hard to work with it.❌ Highly fragranced, Which can irritate the delicate eye are..This is a fail for me 2/10 will never buy again!For more IG: SweetAffordableBeauty</td>\n",

I bought the L’Oreal dual sharpener. After great effort it is possible to get enough liner to the tip to maybe finish one eye; when I tried to line my other eye I was already irritating my upper lid with sharp plastic torn edges of the stick.

It being reasonably priced is a plus. So, I was excited about giving this a try.When I saw that it had arrived in my mailbox this morning, I immediately ripped open the package and thanked goodness I had run errands without makeup so I could try it asap. I like wearing a dark color, but not black, so the combo of grey and “infallible” had me giddy. I kid you not.The pencil glided on beautifully. Very easy to apply, but honestly, I was nervous. How could something so creamy be a waterproof “infallible” all-day pencil? I figured I would find out.First off, it does smear, but I’ve put on enough eyeliner and eye pencil in my day to know to let it set, so I did and went about my business for the afternoon.I made supper, did the dishes, and after I was cleaning up remembered that I was wearing this supposedly fantastic new makeup. So, I went to the nearest mirror to check on how it was doing and well, it was gone.I recently got new glasses and was tired to boot, so I thought maybe I was losing it. I mean, not quite five hours and my eyeliner had disappeared? What about “infallible” and “24 hour wear?”  Even my eyeliners without any hype do better than five hours. I asked my husband if he saw any evidence I had put eyeliner on and he shrugged, “Maybe your eyelashes look darker?” Poor guy.What really baffles me is that others are reporting that this is amazing stuff. Maybe there’s different batches. I dunno. All I know is that if I want to wear an eyeliner that goes on great and totally disappears without my using eye makeup remover, this does the trick! It’s certainly better than having “raccoon eyes” at the end of the day. But that doesn’t get it two stars in my book.I don’t know the science of why some makeup stays on one person and not another. This whole thing is total mystery. As they say, your mileage may vary, judging from the other reviews.</td>\n",

Even though you can twist the bottom of the pencil, it goes nowhere.  This is a horrible waste of money as you can only get about a week's worth of wear out of it.  Shame on Loreal for doing this to their customers!  They've been in the business long enough to know that if you provide an eye \"pencil\" it will require sharpening and you can't sharpen a plastic shell.

       "      <td>I see lots of rave reviews, which just points out how individual these things are. I read the instructions and tried to remove it in the shower - loads of soap and warm water in there! It was hard to get off - acted a bit like rubber cement.When I exited the shower, the skin under my eyes was dark. That surprised me, as the product appeared to maintain its structural integrity - what I got off of my lashes with a good bit of effort came off as casts of my lashes. Interesting. I would have thought there was nothing to stain my skin with; I was wrong.I did clean that skin with some oil-free eye makeup remover and cotton pads. But it was weird to have that happen! Also, it did not appear to lengthen my lashes at all. I know these things are subjective and my ability to measure any lengthening is clearly limited. I'm just going by my own reflection in the mirror.It acted more like waterproof mascara for me and did not appear to be lengthening. The issue of staining my skin could be an effect of my age - at 60, my skin isn't the same as it was at 20! Possibly, if I had younger skin, I would not have experienced that.In fact, after my first use of the product and my difficulties removing it, I thought I must have misread the package whilst in the store and had accidentally purchased waterproof mascara. I went BACK to the store to get some non-waterproof mascara. I looked at this product in it's packaging and read the instructions again. I was flabbergasted to see that it is supposed to wash off with soap and water and that I DID purchase the item I had intended to purchase, after all. I was astonished by that - for me, it behaves like a waterproof mascara.For me, a MUCH better choice is the \"L'Oreal Paris Double Extend Mascara\" in the gold and white tube. Washes off VERY easily with soap and water and does appear to lengthen my lashes. On the product page of the product I'm reviewing - the red and white tube - it is called \"L'Oreal Paris Double Extend Beauty Tubes.\" It's weird to me that the names are so similar. Can't quite figure that one out.I've seen a few people get upset in these reviews - a bit confused and saddened by that. This is just mascara. It's so unimportant in comparison to everything else in life! If you are upset by my comments about this makeup, please understand that I never intend to offend ANY person. I'm just one old lady who had a bad experience whilst using a product and following the manufacturer's instructions. Hehehe... that reads a bit like a legal disclaimer, doesn't it?Here's the mascara I like - that washes off VERY easily and does appear to lengthen. I cannot have long, luxurious lashes - the older we become, the shorter our lashes are. That's actually true! And I don't wish to mess with false eyelashes. I'm too old to care that much! But I do like a bit more length if I can get it. I like this mascara here:http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-Double-Mascara-Blackest/dp/B0000AJ3Q3/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390607298&amp;sr=8-17&amp;keywords=l%27oreal+mascara</td>\n",

It was also too good to be true. While it certainly does create a \"tube\" around your lashes, it doesn't extend them much, if at all. I noticed no extension effect for the majority of my lashes. There were a few that did extend here and there. I most definitely applied it properly, and am not a newbie to cosmetics.It did last all day, and it also came off easily with warm water and a bit of soap. It gets the two stars for that. Far too often mascara is advertised as flake free, and long lasting, with easy removal, and then promptly fails to live up to any of those. This one did.Another big detractor is that it doesn't add volume. My lashes didn't look much different from regular mascara. They didn't seem separated, there was absolutely no added volume apparent, and finally, the lengthening effect only worked sparsely on a few lashes here and there. Don't waste your money on this one.

       "      <td>I am always on the search for the perfect mascara. As a pale blonde, my eyelashes (and brows) are invisible. My lashes are very long, but they're invisible, so long doesn't matter if you can't see them.A friend recently told me about a tube mascara called \"Blinc.\" I didn't want to spend $25 on a mascara that I had to either buy online or drive 15 miles to Sephora to purchase, so I researched a tube mascara I could buy at a grocery store. This product was the only one I found.I bought it with high hopes I would finally have a mascara that doesn't smudge or worse, flake.  It preforms beautifully on both accounts.  Plus it adds length.. which I don't need. It adds a bit too much length for my tastes, but would be perfect for someone with shorter lashes.  It doesn't add body though, which if fine for daytime wear.I was skeptical about the white \"conditioner\" I was to apply first.  So the first day I tried the conditioner on one eye, but not the other. I could tell no difference in the application of the mascara, the wear, or the removal. Not sure what exactly the conditioner is meant for.. Never thought to condition my lashes before. I would gladly give the white stuff up for a longer tube of mascara.  See, this mascara is divided into two parts. The wands are therefore short. Too short, in my opinion.  We are all used to longer wands on our mascara. The short wand makes it a bit more difficult to reach the corners of my eyes without putting my hands on my face. And, I fear that because the actual tubes of mascara are so short, this mascara will run out soon.This mascara seems to only be available in black, and blackest black. Nothing for us fair haired people... no black brown or brown.  I don't like to look so severe during the day with a black mascara against my fair skin and light hair, but the black is fine. It's not stark at all. It is passable for daytime wear for a fair blonde.The biggest drawback for me is the removal. Yes, it does remove like a dream when you are ready. Just a little moisture, and they come right off. Yes, they are like little tubes, and become very pliable, almost \"gooey\" when they get wet.  My problem with this is, although the package says water resistant, any little moisture makes my eyelashes clump together. Then I just touch them and the mascara lifts right off my lash. I'm just talking a little tear from the cold weather. I can't imagine how one would look right after crying, or laughing, or how it would wear in the summer with perspiration.So while it is wonderful at not smudging or smearing on dry skin, it will come completely off with any little bit of moisture, which to me, is worse than smudging</td>\n",

I wiped excess mascara on the tube opening, applied lightly, and used a separate lash comb to evenly distribute both ends of the product. My lashes still were slightly more clumpy than with other brands, but not terrible. The mascara itself was so messy to apply that i would need to use a moistened q tip to clean up my eyelids. It would just get everywhere.It doesn't flake like other mascaras. Actually, it stays on like glue. If I accidentally fell asleep without removing, my lashes were still covered the next morning. Removing with warm or hot water was interesting but it comes off in clumps...like dried glue. My biggest complaint is that I lost eyelashes. With other mascaras, I'd have the occasional lost lash but not like this. Removing this one would cost me several lashes on each eye. Not worth it with prolonged use.Also, after two weeks the consistency changed and dried out significantly. Still usable but doesn't seem to last nearly as long as typical mascara.This stuff, when applied carefully and correctly looks pretty nice, but it's damaging to eyelashes, messy, and doesn't seem that the tube will last very long before drying out.This is definitely not for me. I wouldn't recommend it. If it wasn't so damaging to my natural lashes i would have tolerated the mess and short life.Keep looking, there's better mascara out there.</td>\n",

I did notice that you have to be careful to clean this brush regularly as well otherwise the product will build up on the sides you don't use it on, and the clumps will worsen. One pro is that it seems to be lightweight mascara. I have straight eyelashes that go down. I can get them to curl nicely, however after I apply mascara usually they fall down almost to where they were before. This does the same, however not as far as most mascaras do.

I chose this product because my powder compact matched one of the \"true matches\" for this color &amp; since I'm not that skilled in picking out blushes, I liked that it was an easy choice. The product is easily blended &amp; feels very light on my skin.Now for the bad part of the review. The packaging &amp; design. It's horrible. I had to look to 2 stores before I found a blush compact where the powder wasn't smashed up. The first store's compacts had one that was physically damaged so I assumed that the powders were smashed up due to improper handling during transit. The 2nd store I went to had the blushes in both damaged &amp; undamaged conditions. Again, I assumed this was due to improper handling during transit. I purchased my blush &amp; went on about my life. Then when I returned home, the compact fell off of a very short coffee table to the ground, no more than 10 inches in height. It fell onto not only a padded carpet floor but also a nice thick rug on top of that floor, so it's not like it fell onto a hard surface. And guess what? The compact's powder was completely smashed up.The delicateness of the powder doesn't hurt the look of the makeup, but it does make it far less convenient for me to put on when I'm on the go. I also have to watch to ensure that I don't put too much on due to it being in a now loose powder form. (It's easy to get more on then you bargained for.) As a result I use it far less than I would have if it wasn't loose &amp; I doubt that I'll purchase this again when this expires or runs out.

I hate wasting money so I thought I'd try it as an eye cream at night... and really thought ... am I crazy ... this really can't be reversing all the benefits of my other products right? After 3 days of using it as an eye cream I have DARK circles under my eyes right where I applied it and what looks like Melesma ( and I am not pregnant!) I AM SO DISAPPOINTED! I even went so far as writing the company I get my TruSkin Naturals products from to see if she had ever heard of anyone having a reaction from a collagen based product that might counteract the effects of what is in their products and she had never heard of this and said many women use collagen products with their products and never had a problem. There has to be something in this that reacts to my skin cause I am at a loss and am so bummed! As far as how it felt and smelled... like I said I wanted to love it and thought I would... I loved how it smelled even tho for some who don't like fragrance it might be strong and the consistency is very rich yet feels almost between a gel and a cream and a little goes a long way. Feels good on the skin, it really did, but their is no way I would ever use it again. It has gone in the trash! Never been so disappointed with a product in my life. I'd rather it have not worked at all then completely reverse all the amazing benefits I had with my other products. I should've left well enough alone! 😕</td>\n",

First I tried it as a coverage foundation but it was too sheer and it didnt cover anything or fix and natural color blemishes of my face. (I'd like to mention that I did choose a shade way too light).I cleamed that off and used the last bit of my almay foundation and used this to highlight. That worked out pretty well and even though I didnt love it, I could definitely work with it.What ruined the look was when I used the loreal trumatch powder and it made my whole face cakey and really defined my pores.I asked my husband how the make up looked and his exact words were \"It looks like you got old...QUICK\"I dont recommend this product and I am disappointed.I'll give 2 stars for the packaging and the highlighting effect.</td>\n",

However, it just did not perform as I expected.WHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE?This cleanser is a green color, which would lead me to expect that it would have a fresh natural fragrance.  I also would expect it to have a natural fresh feeling.  It comes in a squeeze tube which dispenses little squiggles of cleanser so you won't end up with too much accidentally.  The cleanser has a very pungent smell, I would say that it is cloying and overbearing.HOW DOES THIS CLEANSER WORK?What you do is wet your face.  Then you put on the cleanser after rubbing it between wet hands so it becomes a \"mousse\".  You smear it all over your face and massage it for a bit and then rinse off.  The product claims that it is not too drying.  It also claims to clean and brighten too.MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CLEANSERCONTENTS AND SCENTFirst of all, I was very surprised to find that this cleanser has sodium lauryl sulfate in it.  That is a high foaming de-greaser which I tend to avoid in most products.  It is not what I would expect in a clay based cleanser.  The smell was overbearing- on the edge of nauseating to me, and I found myself not wanting to smell it anymore, even after it had been rinsed away a while.DOES IT DRY SKIN?Contrary to the claims, the sodium lauryl sulfate which tends to be harsh on the skin was not offset by the glycerine in the product which is supposed to moisturize the face.  I felt that it made my skin too tight and I did not like the feeling.  I have normal skin this time of year.THE BOTTOM LINEI really did not like this cleanser.  It stripped my skin too much, smelled overbearing which made me want to not use it, and I felt that it just did not turn out to be as \"natural\" as I expected it to be.  I usually reserve 1 star for products that I absolutely hate, but I have a hard time giving this two stars.  So, this is a 1 star rating.If they had given it a natural fresh scent and left out the sodium lauryl sulfate, this could have been a nicer product.  As it is, I just found it overbearing and not anything I would want to use again.</td>\n",

I finally just tossed this stuff. Lowering my stars to 3 thought I thought of making it 2 stars. But I’ll leave my initial review anyway since I did like the cleanser otherwise—at least at first.————The scent: - way too overpowering. But at least it’s not flowery.How: This is a clay-like lotion. Dark green in color that you rub your hands/fingers together to create the mousse-like cream to apply. It's thick when you squeeze it out, but turns into a lighter substance once your rub your hands/fingers together. Applying to the face it's gentle and smooth. Quite nice! Feels wonderful.The cleansing: I love that this isn't a too sudsy face cleanser. I do have those, and I will use them from time to time, but this cleanser goes on smoothly and washes away quickly and cleanly.The price: Here, I have a cleanser that is just as nice as salon product but for a fraction of the cost.

I don’t understand all of these positive reviews.  It’s quicker to just slather on the tanner than to use these.  They dry out quickly so if you are doing arms, legs, face, and you start at the top, it will dry out on your first leg.

You would think this is a good thing. It is not. This makes it so that you cannot tell at all where you have used it, where you have not, where needs more, etc. The result is a streaky finish and uneven tan. I thought maybe the first time I used them I had a learning curve so I gave it another try and….same thing. This could totally be user error on my part but I think this could be improved immensely by giving some trace of where it has been applied.

You do not want to touch other parts of your body when applying this. Second, apply well in advance before your special event or vacation. If you don't like it, then you'll have some time for it to fade. Third, don't put this on your face!After trying these wipes, I'm convinced there s no self-tanning product that is worth buying.

I don't know much about skincare or what ingredients you should be looking for except that I knew hyaluronic acid is an extreme moisturizing ingredient that my skin needed which is why I bought this.  I found out (from experts in skin care) that this product could of been the cause of my breakouts because it uses the ingredient hydroxyethylpiperazine ethane sulfonic acid as a buffering agent which this agent is one of the worse buffering agents to use. hyaluronic acid is known for its moisturizing effects because it takes moisture from the air and holds that moisture in your skin. Suflonic acid (buffering agent) pulls everything in the air with the moisture, for instance, pollution, UV, sunlight, and other molecules that are damaging to your skin. What is scary is that we don't see the damage until a while down the road therefore at first this was great as it secretly damaged my skin, extremely. I went through 2 bottles.

I had her put lotion on her knees, elbows, ankles and knuckles first. So I out gloves on so my hands wouldn't be funky the next day. Make sure you put some plactis wrap on the counter before you use the bottle and get it all greasy, along with the floor. So I used the gloves, each pump a different part, such as I started with the arms one by one, completely covering them, You can easily tell where you put it because it has a wet look. It takes a LONG time to dry. You pretty much stand there in front of a fan for at least 15 minutes. I tried it on myself also and it was a gross sticky feeling the whole time I had it on. The smell is ok but I kind of drives you nuts after awhile. You have to make sure I you go in your car to put a towel on the seat bottom and back. You have to let it sit at least 4 hours to get some color. You do get a nice color, but even when I applied it very evenly to her, it still wasn't fully even and had odd splotches and spots.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I thought this was a treatment product for the sensitive eye area, but it's really more like make-up.  It's not exactly concealer, nor is it a primer or highlighter.  It reminds me very much of a product that was popular back in the 1980's - Glowtion by Ultima II.  Is anyone old enough to remember their ads with Cybill Shepherd?Anyhow, this is a sheer peachy/rosy toned cream that is being marketed as a brightener for the skin around the eyes.  Because I have very dark circles (entirely encircling my eyes), I was hopeful [yet skeptical] that it would make any improvement.  Unfortunately, because it's much more sheer than an actual concealer, the reduction in the appearance of my dark circles was extremely minimal.  I did notice a slight rosy glow to the area, which only made me realize the product would probably work better as a substitute for blush and/or highlighter on the cheekbones, rather than under the eyes.Overall, a disappointment.</td>\n",

I loved the wand and the mascara. Needing to get more I found this on Amazon yeah.. NOT!this is a different formula than the one I had initially purchased. I wanted to try the waterproof version.It was a bit higher in price but I loved the other one so much I thought it would be worth the extra cost.After waiting for it to arrive because of a backorder. I finally got it! Tried it right out of the box. What a disappointment 😣 the first coat you couldn't even tell I had mascara on. I tried coat after coat and no coverage. It did absolutely nothing. Almost as if there was clear mascara in there. So I wiped the wand with a tissue and it was black. I tried again.. Same thing. I had to back and use my old standby.I have been using Loreal mascara for many many years and have never been so disappointed in a product.Total waste of money.I will buy the original formula from now on.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I don't hate this mascara, but I don't like it either. So you know where I'm coming from, I have naturally very long thin eyelashes with blonde tips. What I generally look for from a mascara is definition, colour and if possible thickness, I prefer short spiky brushes that comb and define my lashes, getting every part of them. If your needs are definition and colour and you have similar lashes, this mascara is not for you.First let's talk about the gimmick; the bendable wand. It's a cool idea, immediately I thought 'oh yay, I can get those tricky corner lashes', but it didn't work well. I practiced and practiced, but no matter how many times I applied, it just felt totally awkward, tickled my lashes and I ended up smudging it all over my face. The formula smudges very easily so if you make even a little mistake, it's a big clean-up job. It also promises lift, but my eyelashes (uncurled) actually went down more than anything, they weren't lifted at all.The other thing about the formula is that it's not clumpy, but it leaves your lashes really spidery, even after combing and I'm not a fan of that look. The straight brush worked better, but this just isn't a mascara that worked well with my lash type, so I wouldn't use it again. I thought the black colour was very nice and dark, but I didn't like the formula consistency, brush, or finished effect.</td>\n",

It's super thick like a mousse, feels thick and heavy going on and takes forever to dry down even with a thin layer. And even then it remains vaguely tacky like I have glue or something on my lips unless I take it off. It's gross.Also, it's a nightmare to get off! I wear one of the most bulletproof mascaras ever (Kiss Me Heroine) that will literally stand up in the ocean and when I'm dripping sweat while working outside in the dead of summer without budging (and I mean that, I've worn it in those instances multiple times). My cleansing oil will take that mascara right off with a little light massaging. This lipstick? It took THREE rounds of my cleansing oil to get it off and I was practically scrubbing with a damn cotton pad the last time.Loreal needs to re-evaluate the formula on these things or something because it's terrible right now.</td>\n",

I exfoliate religiously and there are no dead cells on my skin, but I\"m still pale and yellowish.  So I decided to try this to perk up my coloration a bit, because I'm afraid that if I fall asleep, my grands will think I'm dead and bury me.First of all, this is not an easy product to find.  I went to five places before I found it.My experience:This is the first item I've bought in years that comes in a jar instead of a pumper bottle or tube.  So the first time my clean finger touched it, it was contaminated.  I use a coffee stirrer to scoop it out of the jar.  Don't buy products that come in jars!It's quite thick and stiff, so before applying, I rub my hands together for a few seconds to warm it up and hopefully make it more spreadable.  Doesn't work.  So I'm rubbing and pulling on my skin while applying.  Major no-no.Despite being so thick, it's not emollient enough for me.  So I'm doing a double application:  apply it, wait five minutes for it to absorb, and reapply.It's fragranced.  Booooo.It does't impart much color.  And that's what I bought it for.The price is right, compared to other toiletries, but ultimately, it's not worth it and I won't buy it again.  I don't hate it, and it's not ruining my skin, but... no thanks.The only reason I'm not pitching it out is that I'm too cheap.  So I'll use it up and that'll be it for this product.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I compared two rose tinted skin creams, putting them each on one half of my face for a about two weeks.1. Neutrogena Bright Boost Gel Cream, Brightening Face Moisturizer: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B081DJ199F2. L'Oreal Paris Face Moisturizer Age Perfect Renewal Tinted Rosy Tone Day Cream:https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01M09QQI0Note: I do not expect to see cumulative results so I am providing this review after only two weeks.  If I see any improvement from ongoing use of either product, I'll update this review.I don't buy into the face cream hype, so my expectations were low:  simply that the cream would make my face look a bit pink, would make my face feel moisturized, and that it would have a pleasant scent.I think of these rosy creams as more of a cosmetic than a skin boosting cream – something that will make a visible difference in the moment and wash off after, without any long-term impact.  However, neither creates a lasting or even temporary change in skin tone tone (I'm fair and it would definitely show).  The Neutrogena feels like a base to put makeup over because it seems to create a smooth surface.  My face didn't feel any more moisturized after use but I like how it feels a bit tight and dry to the touch.  The L’Oreal feels a bit oily throughout the day.The L'Oreal has a mild scent that smells a bit like an old lady. The Neutrogena has a mild, slightly floral scent.The L’Oreal goes on fairly thick and and absorbs into the skin faster than the Neutrogena.  It has a matte tone to it and although other reviewers comment on sparkles, I didn’t see any in my 10X magnifying mirror. The Neutrogena feels nice on the skin and has a pearly iridescence.  It's a bit on the runny side (I don’t know why it’s called a “gel”). There are tiny sparkle flecks (you can see them in a 10x magnifying mirror) which may help with the claim for \"brightness\".Overall, my skin seems a bit smoother than on the side that I used Neutrogena on.  It’s not enough to say there’s a noticeable difference between the two products.The Neutrogena marketing claims the cream boosts cell turnover by 10 times - but how do you even know that?  The L'Oreal marketing language is less extreme and more believable.The results are subjective, but I think my skin looks marginally brighter on the Neutrogena half of my face and it goes on light.  Overall, I preferred the Neutrogena to the L'Oreal product.</td>\n",

I'm 46 so my skin is becoming more demanding, and this product strikes me as almost a little bit clay-like, both in scent and in the way it sits on top of my skin. Problem is I need my moisturizer to sink in deep so my skin won't tug when I smile (etc), and this one doesn't do the trick. When I finally put some of my old moisturizer on after a few weeks of this one, the difference was incredible.It's thicker than most day creams and feels almost a tiny bit clay-like as it goes on, but doesn't look too artificial or interfere with my makeup so I suppose it does no harm. It's listed as \"unscented\" (which I appreciate), and there's only the faintest bit of a clay-like scent. I appreciate that they didn't cover it up with something worse, although it's not my favorite either (I prefer relatively natural scents you get from some moisturizing oils in their natural state).

Then it all went down hill.  By the 3rd day the \"rosy\" tone was way too pink, almost ruddy. I started to notice dryness in some places and very clogged blackheads in other places, so clogged that my skin felt rough on the surface. By the 4th day I had a lot of white heads forming and a breakout.  I read all these positive reviews and really do not know what skin type one has to have in order for this cream to work.  For what it's worth, I'm 43, I have moderately fair, combination skin, that is tending toward being more dry in the last couple years. I usually only experience hormone related breakout once a month or when using a particular product. I don't wear foundation so this cream did not \"interact\" with any other product on my skin. This product does have a scent that is stronger than I expected for a face cream, and while I didn't think it was overpowering per se, I didn't particularly like the scent either.</td>\n",

       "654    I'm on the sallow end of the scale, and always have been, even as a child.  It has nothing to do with \"dead cells,\" as the blurb would have you believe.  I exfoliate religiously and there are no dead cells on my skin, but I\"m still pale and yellowish.  So I decided to try this to perk up my coloration a bit, because I'm afraid that if I fall asleep, my grands will think I'm dead and bury me.First of all, this is not an easy product to find.  I went to five places before I found it.My experience:This is the first item I've bought in years that comes in a jar instead of a pumper bottle or tube.  So the first time my clean finger touched it, it was contaminated.  I use a coffee stirrer to scoop it out of the jar.  Don't buy products that come in jars!It's quite thick and stiff, so before applying, I rub my hands together for a few seconds to warm it up and hopefully make it more spreadable.  Doesn't work.  So I'm rubbing and pulling on my skin while applying.  Major no-no.Despite being so thick, it's not emollient enough for me.  So I'm doing a double application:  apply it, wait five minutes for it to absorb, and reapply.It's fragranced.  Booooo.It does't impart much color.  And that's what I bought it for.The price is right, compared to other toiletries, but ultimately, it's not worth it and I won't buy it again.  I don't hate it, and it's not ruining my skin, but... no thanks.The only reason I'm not pitching it out is that I'm too cheap.  So I'll use it up and that'll be it for this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "939    I compared two rose tinted skin creams, putting them each on one half of my face for a about two weeks.1. Neutrogena Bright Boost Gel Cream, Brightening Face Moisturizer: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B081DJ199F2. L'Oreal Paris Face Moisturizer Age Perfect Renewal Tinted Rosy Tone Day Cream:https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01M09QQI0Note: I do not expect to see cumulative results so I am providing this review after only two weeks.  If I see any improvement from ongoing use of either product, I'll update this review.I don't buy into the face cream hype, so my expectations were low:  simply that the cream would make my face look a bit pink, would make my face feel moisturized, and that it would have a pleasant scent.I think of these rosy creams as more of a cosmetic than a skin boosting cream – something that will make a visible difference in the moment and wash off after, without any long-term impact.  However, neither creates a lasting or even temporary change in skin tone tone (I'm fair and it would definitely show).  The Neutrogena feels like a base to put makeup over because it seems to create a smooth surface.  My face didn't feel any more moisturized after use but I like how it feels a bit tight and dry to the touch.  The L’Oreal feels a bit oily throughout the day.The L'Oreal has a mild scent that smells a bit like an old lady. The Neutrogena has a mild, slightly floral scent.The L’Oreal goes on fairly thick and and absorbs into the skin faster than the Neutrogena.  It has a matte tone to it and although other reviewers comment on sparkles, I didn’t see any in my 10X magnifying mirror. The Neutrogena feels nice on the skin and has a pearly iridescence.  It's a bit on the runny side (I don’t know why it’s called a “gel”). There are tiny sparkle flecks (you can see them in a 10x magnifying mirror) which may help with the claim for \"brightness\".Overall, my skin seems a bit smoother than on the side that I used Neutrogena on.  It’s not enough to say there’s a noticeable difference between the two products.The Neutrogena marketing claims the cream boosts cell turnover by 10 times - but how do you even know that?  The L'Oreal marketing language is less extreme and more believable.The results are subjective, but I think my skin looks marginally brighter on the Neutrogena half of my face and it goes on light.  Overall, I preferred the Neutrogena to the L'Oreal product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1555   UPDATE: I'm dropping this down to 2 stars now that I've had it for a few weeks because it doesn't moisturize nearly as well as I need it to (or as well as my other products). I'm 46 so my skin is becoming more demanding, and this product strikes me as almost a little bit clay-like, both in scent and in the way it sits on top of my skin. Problem is I need my moisturizer to sink in deep so my skin won't tug when I smile (etc), and this one doesn't do the trick. When I finally put some of my old moisturizer on after a few weeks of this one, the difference was incredible.It's thicker than most day creams and feels almost a tiny bit clay-like as it goes on, but doesn't look too artificial or interfere with my makeup so I suppose it does no harm. It's listed as \"unscented\" (which I appreciate), and there's only the faintest bit of a clay-like scent. I appreciate that they didn't cover it up with something worse, although it's not my favorite either (I prefer relatively natural scents you get from some moisturizing oils in their natural state). But again, it doesn't work well enough for my aging skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1665   This product was great for about 2 days. In those first 2 days my skin looked fantastic, smoother and had a great color tone, I thought I'd found the holy grail.  Then it all went down hill.  By the 3rd day the \"rosy\" tone was way too pink, almost ruddy. I started to notice dryness in some places and very clogged blackheads in other places, so clogged that my skin felt rough on the surface. By the 4th day I had a lot of white heads forming and a breakout.  I read all these positive reviews and really do not know what skin type one has to have in order for this cream to work.  For what it's worth, I'm 43, I have moderately fair, combination skin, that is tending toward being more dry in the last couple years. I usually only experience hormone related breakout once a month or when using a particular product. I don't wear foundation so this cream did not \"interact\" with any other product on my skin. This product does have a scent that is stronger than I expected for a face cream, and while I didn't think it was overpowering per se, I didn't particularly like the scent either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2134   I don't know how good the product is. The third product Amazon tried to send is still the wrong product. I have never been so disappointed in Amazon in the many years I've been a Prime member. I'm writing this to warn you, maybe you'll be lucky. I ordered Infallible Pro-Glow in Buff Beige. I promptly received Infallible Pro-Glow Classic Tan. Unexplainably it was in a box that read the correct foundation in the correct color. Knowing it was way too dark for me I want on line to exchange it for the correct color. There were no problems, it was as easy as an original order. That is until I looked at the confirmation order and noticed that Amazon would send Classic Tan again! This made no sense. I had originally ordered Pro-Glow Buff Beige, the old order showed Pro-Glow Buff Beige and they were going to send Pro-Glow Classic Tan? As unsavory as the thought was, I knew I had to talk to a person. Trying to reach a person at Amazon is not for the faint of heart. Nevertheless I knew that's what I had to do.The person on the phone helped me, told me I had to click the link emailed to make sure I got the right product. I thought it was correct so I ordered. I can't verify it was the correct product now, but the bottles are shaped different and I really scrutinized that order before I clicked. Today I received the correct color, but it was a different product, it was the Infallible Total Cover. I give up. Three strikes I'm out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2456   We were sent #350 Bisque.It was too dark for our skin tones.Unfortunately it not only was too dark but it::::  felt too heavy  left dark lines in the tiniest of cracks, even after moisturizer was  applied.  barely did any covering up of blemishes and,  seemed to have a drying affect on the skin.Given a choice we would have chosen a lighter shade for ourselves.Taking into consideration that a lighter shade might make enough of a difference that the skin 'cracks' wouldn't be accented, we didn't take a star off.Because it didn't seem to make much difference in concealing or at least partially concealing dark spots and veins, we removed a star. ( we don't think that a different colour would have made a difference in covering up)Since it also seemed to dry the skin out, we removed another star.The wand has a sponge-type end and even though we don't use concealer directly from an applicator, we know that a lot of people do.To us, this is very unsanitary and can cause bacteria from the sponge to build up inside the tube so we removed an additional star because of the company's use of a sponge applicator.We were quite sad to not be able to give this one of our usual high star ratings .L'Oreal is one of our favourite lines and we've enjoy testing many of their incredible products for review.Even though we could only give this specific product a 2 star rating we think that there are people who would be able to use this liquid full wear product successfully.It's just a shame that we couldn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2500   I use this concealer as my normal concealer and normally love it so this review is based on the product that comes from this seller in particular  I can however say that something was not right about the one I received from this seller, first off when I received it the seal was broken it was a combination of chunky and watery and the smell was somewhat of an alcohol base and very strong at that, I was already out the door and doing a quick get ready in my car and grabbed this concealer thinking it was my current one since I never opened the new once & I threw it in my bag so It would be there when I ran out of my current one I realized quickly that it wasn’t when I put it under my eyes and my skin started burning the smell was so strong my eyes teared up!!! Definitely Not the same formula as the one sold in stores so I highly caution you not to purchase this item from this seller and I may all together stop buying makeup products as well as consumables from 3rd parties online after this experience and an experience I had with some treats I bought for my pups! So disappointing as I purchase so many different things from amazon since it’s so convenient and there customer service is usually pretty good!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "2505   PRICE RANGE: 💲💲@lorealmakeup Infallible More Than Concealer (345/OATMEAL)I don’t know what is it with this concealer no matter what I do, it won’t work for me...I have wore it with foundation, no foundation, set with powder, not set with powder, adding jojoba oil, putting moisturizer around my eye area, not using moisturizer, applying it with brush, fingers and sponges. NOTHING HAS MADE IT WORK!!!.First, it accumulates fast in the fine lines even after working it and setting with powder. Then, within a few hours it loses coverage and accumulates even more. And, it makes you look like you are 10 years older (I’m only 23 btw). Also, my fault this tone is too dark for me and it’s yellowy (oposite to the description “neutral with pink undertones”) so, it looks greenish under my eye area..The finish of this concealer is matte and “full” coverage. It’s thicker than expected but not too bad. It’s supposed to be waterproof, fade and transfer resistant 🧐.This broke my heart, because I bought this full price and it is the most expensive item in my makeup bag and I will probably end up trashing it. However, I might use it to cover pimples since this looks like it’s going to be a good fit for that...BENEFITS:✅ Matte.✅ “Full Coverage”.✅ Wears up to “24H”.✅ Waterproof and fade resistant.✅ Huge applicator and bottle.CONS:❌ It gets in every fine line you’ve got.❌ The coverage fades within hours.❌ Looks greenish in me.❌ The price killed me by comparison to other drugstore concealers.❌ If too much is applied is hard to work with it.❌ Highly fragranced, Which can irritate the delicate eye are..This is a fail for me 2/10 will never buy again!For more IG: SweetAffordableBeauty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "2638   The color Bisque turned out to be way too dark for my very fair complexion.  It was supposed to be a light tone but came out more a muddy beige tone.  I have had both the shades Fawn and Oatmeal which I believe are probably better for fair skin.  I love the giant applicator wand on this product and I have found that you are able to use the product to the last drop without much of it sticking to the bottle.  There is very little smell only slightly slightly chemical.  Coverage is excellent from my past experiences with the product.  It is not sticky and does not smear or run and I have found that it does not really transfer off on anything too much.  Blend quickly because it will dry quickly.  My ultra sensitive skin has not had a problem with this product on the face.  The reason I am only giving this 2 stars is because the color was all wrong compared to the description.  If you buy the correct color then I would give it 4 stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "4738   I didn’t try L’Oreal eyeliner for a long time after the debacle with their Silkissime Infallible liner, which could not be properly sharpened. Since they took it off the market, I assumed they fixed the problem when they launched this replacement eyeliner. I decided to give L’Oreal one more try because Revlon discontinued the brown-bronze color I liked. This L’Oreal eyeliner could not be sharpened properly with my store brand eyeliner sharpener. I bought the L’Oreal dual sharpener. After great effort it is possible to get enough liner to the tip to maybe finish one eye; when I tried to line my other eye I was already irritating my upper lid with sharp plastic torn edges of the stick. I question how well L’Oreal is testing their products. Do they send the product home with the consumer panel, or is it just being tested in a lab? I will not purchase again, and will only buy wood eyeliner pencils from now on. I don’t like hurting my delicate lid, nor wasting money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "4762   I saw this eyeliner in a L'Oreal ad and wanted to duplicate the model's liner design. I threw away the packaging without reading it--thinking the product was either a gel or liquid. I did not try the product until several weeks later. To my surprise, nothing happened when I began lining. I tried it on my hand, pressing harder and harder with each stroke until the tip of the color stick came off! So I thought perhaps it is a mechanical pencil. I turned the bottom of the pencil but the color stick did not advance. It looked like a mechanical pencil, I could see that the stick of blue crayon was loose inside the casing. Finally I emailed L'Oreal and found out it is a regular pencil, to be sharpened with a regular pencil sharpener. After I sharpened it, I tried it on the back of my hand, it still would not make a mark unless I pressed with all my might. I believe it was dried out. I let L'Oreal know, they sent me a coupon for the full amount to buy whatever I wanted. Disappointed it didn't work, it is a smashing color.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "4770   I do wear the “smoky eye pencil” look on most days and am always on the lookout for a good pencil that lasts, doesn’t leave “raccoon eyes,” or smudge. It being reasonably priced is a plus. So, I was excited about giving this a try.When I saw that it had arrived in my mailbox this morning, I immediately ripped open the package and thanked goodness I had run errands without makeup so I could try it asap. I like wearing a dark color, but not black, so the combo of grey and “infallible” had me giddy. I kid you not.The pencil glided on beautifully. Very easy to apply, but honestly, I was nervous. How could something so creamy be a waterproof “infallible” all-day pencil? I figured I would find out.First off, it does smear, but I’ve put on enough eyeliner and eye pencil in my day to know to let it set, so I did and went about my business for the afternoon.I made supper, did the dishes, and after I was cleaning up remembered that I was wearing this supposedly fantastic new makeup. So, I went to the nearest mirror to check on how it was doing and well, it was gone.I recently got new glasses and was tired to boot, so I thought maybe I was losing it. I mean, not quite five hours and my eyeliner had disappeared? What about “infallible” and “24 hour wear?”  Even my eyeliners without any hype do better than five hours. I asked my husband if he saw any evidence I had put eyeliner on and he shrugged, “Maybe your eyelashes look darker?” Poor guy.What really baffles me is that others are reporting that this is amazing stuff. Maybe there’s different batches. I dunno. All I know is that if I want to wear an eyeliner that goes on great and totally disappears without my using eye makeup remover, this does the trick! It’s certainly better than having “raccoon eyes” at the end of the day. But that doesn’t get it two stars in my book.I don’t know the science of why some makeup stays on one person and not another. This whole thing is total mystery. As they say, your mileage may vary, judging from the other reviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "4885   The actual eyeliner is great.  It lives up to the hype of waterproof, glides on easy, and smudge-resistant.  It is great for about the first five times you apply it.  After that, the pencil cannot be sharpened!  I did my research, read the reviews, and figured if I bought the \"right\" pencil sharpener, it should be no problem.  Nope!  Even their own sharpener won't sharpen their pencils.  This eyeliner is basically in a hard, plastic shell that will require an industrial strength, electric sharpener to make any progress.  Even though you can twist the bottom of the pencil, it goes nowhere.  This is a horrible waste of money as you can only get about a week's worth of wear out of it.  Shame on Loreal for doing this to their customers!  They've been in the business long enough to know that if you provide an eye \"pencil\" it will require sharpening and you can't sharpen a plastic shell.  The pat answer from them is to buy their sharpener.  I've now gone through four sharpeners, including some high end ones, and nothing.

       "5437   I see lots of rave reviews, which just points out how individual these things are. I read the instructions and tried to remove it in the shower - loads of soap and warm water in there! It was hard to get off - acted a bit like rubber cement.When I exited the shower, the skin under my eyes was dark. That surprised me, as the product appeared to maintain its structural integrity - what I got off of my lashes with a good bit of effort came off as casts of my lashes. Interesting. I would have thought there was nothing to stain my skin with; I was wrong.I did clean that skin with some oil-free eye makeup remover and cotton pads. But it was weird to have that happen! Also, it did not appear to lengthen my lashes at all. I know these things are subjective and my ability to measure any lengthening is clearly limited. I'm just going by my own reflection in the mirror.It acted more like waterproof mascara for me and did not appear to be lengthening. The issue of staining my skin could be an effect of my age - at 60, my skin isn't the same as it was at 20! Possibly, if I had younger skin, I would not have experienced that.In fact, after my first use of the product and my difficulties removing it, I thought I must have misread the package whilst in the store and had accidentally purchased waterproof mascara. I went BACK to the store to get some non-waterproof mascara. I looked at this product in it's packaging and read the instructions again. I was flabbergasted to see that it is supposed to wash off with soap and water and that I DID purchase the item I had intended to purchase, after all. I was astonished by that - for me, it behaves like a waterproof mascara.For me, a MUCH better choice is the \"L'Oreal Paris Double Extend Mascara\" in the gold and white tube. Washes off VERY easily with soap and water and does appear to lengthen my lashes. On the product page of the product I'm reviewing - the red and white tube - it is called \"L'Oreal Paris Double Extend Beauty Tubes.\" It's weird to me that the names are so similar. Can't quite figure that one out.I've seen a few people get upset in these reviews - a bit confused and saddened by that. This is just mascara. It's so unimportant in comparison to everything else in life! If you are upset by my comments about this makeup, please understand that I never intend to offend ANY person. I'm just one old lady who had a bad experience whilst using a product and following the manufacturer's instructions. Hehehe... that reads a bit like a legal disclaimer, doesn't it?Here's the mascara I like - that washes off VERY easily and does appear to lengthen. I cannot have long, luxurious lashes - the older we become, the shorter our lashes are. That's actually true! And I don't wish to mess with false eyelashes. I'm too old to care that much! But I do like a bit more length if I can get it. I like this mascara here:http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-Double-Mascara-Blackest/dp/B0000AJ3Q3/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&qid=1390607298&sr=8-17&keywords=l%27oreal+mascara\n",
       "6505   L'Oreal Double Extend Lash Extension Effect Mascara ~ 570 Black\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  I was in the market for a new mascara, and I chose this one, as the commercials I've seen for it made it irresistible. It was also too good to be true. While it certainly does create a \"tube\" around your lashes, it doesn't extend them much, if at all. I noticed no extension effect for the majority of my lashes. There were a few that did extend here and there. I most definitely applied it properly, and am not a newbie to cosmetics.It did last all day, and it also came off easily with warm water and a bit of soap. It gets the two stars for that. Far too often mascara is advertised as flake free, and long lasting, with easy removal, and then promptly fails to live up to any of those. This one did.Another big detractor is that it doesn't add volume. My lashes didn't look much different from regular mascara. They didn't seem separated, there was absolutely no added volume apparent, and finally, the lengthening effect only worked sparsely on a few lashes here and there. Don't waste your money on this one. Good concept and idea, bad performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "6541   I am always on the search for the perfect mascara. As a pale blonde, my eyelashes (and brows) are invisible. My lashes are very long, but they're invisible, so long doesn't matter if you can't see them.A friend recently told me about a tube mascara called \"Blinc.\" I didn't want to spend $25 on a mascara that I had to either buy online or drive 15 miles to Sephora to purchase, so I researched a tube mascara I could buy at a grocery store. This product was the only one I found.I bought it with high hopes I would finally have a mascara that doesn't smudge or worse, flake.  It preforms beautifully on both accounts.  Plus it adds length.. which I don't need. It adds a bit too much length for my tastes, but would be perfect for someone with shorter lashes.  It doesn't add body though, which if fine for daytime wear.I was skeptical about the white \"conditioner\" I was to apply first.  So the first day I tried the conditioner on one eye, but not the other. I could tell no difference in the application of the mascara, the wear, or the removal. Not sure what exactly the conditioner is meant for.. Never thought to condition my lashes before. I would gladly give the white stuff up for a longer tube of mascara.  See, this mascara is divided into two parts. The wands are therefore short. Too short, in my opinion.  We are all used to longer wands on our mascara. The short wand makes it a bit more difficult to reach the corners of my eyes without putting my hands on my face. And, I fear that because the actual tubes of mascara are so short, this mascara will run out soon.This mascara seems to only be available in black, and blackest black. Nothing for us fair haired people... no black brown or brown.  I don't like to look so severe during the day with a black mascara against my fair skin and light hair, but the black is fine. It's not stark at all. It is passable for daytime wear for a fair blonde.The biggest drawback for me is the removal. Yes, it does remove like a dream when you are ready. Just a little moisture, and they come right off. Yes, they are like little tubes, and become very pliable, almost \"gooey\" when they get wet.  My problem with this is, although the package says water resistant, any little moisture makes my eyelashes clump together. Then I just touch them and the mascara lifts right off my lash. I'm just talking a little tear from the cold weather. I can't imagine how one would look right after crying, or laughing, or how it would wear in the summer with perspiration.So while it is wonderful at not smudging or smearing on dry skin, it will come completely off with any little bit of moisture, which to me, is worse than smudging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "6569   I wanted to love this mascara. The only things I loved was that it does truly add length to your lashes and was simple to remove with just water.Here's what I hated:A mess to apply. I wiped excess mascara on the tube opening, applied lightly, and used a separate lash comb to evenly distribute both ends of the product. My lashes still were slightly more clumpy than with other brands, but not terrible. The mascara itself was so messy to apply that i would need to use a moistened q tip to clean up my eyelids. It would just get everywhere.It doesn't flake like other mascaras. Actually, it stays on like glue. If I accidentally fell asleep without removing, my lashes were still covered the next morning. Removing with warm or hot water was interesting but it comes off in clumps...like dried glue. My biggest complaint is that I lost eyelashes. With other mascaras, I'd have the occasional lost lash but not like this. Removing this one would cost me several lashes on each eye. Not worth it with prolonged use.Also, after two weeks the consistency changed and dried out significantly. Still usable but doesn't seem to last nearly as long as typical mascara.This stuff, when applied carefully and correctly looks pretty nice, but it's damaging to eyelashes, messy, and doesn't seem that the tube will last very long before drying out.This is definitely not for me. I wouldn't recommend it. If it wasn't so damaging to my natural lashes i would have tolerated the mess and short life.Keep looking, there's better mascara out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8140   I'm just not a fan of this stuff. I don't know why but I don't like the wand at all. I prefer a straight wand. The curve just doesn't really add much for me, and it doesn't help me apply the mascara any better. I don't know if I purchased an old product or what, but it also seemed slightly dried out. Mainly because, wow, sooo clumpy! I'm shocked by the reviews. This stuff DOES give you spidery lashes. Some people like it. Some don't. I'm not a fan of it. I like my mascara to look smooth and natural. This isn't even close. Very clumpy. I did notice that you have to be careful to clean this brush regularly as well otherwise the product will build up on the sides you don't use it on, and the clumps will worsen. One pro is that it seems to be lightweight mascara. I have straight eyelashes that go down. I can get them to curl nicely, however after I apply mascara usually they fall down almost to where they were before. This does the same, however not as far as most mascaras do. I wore two coats and almost couldn't feel that I had any on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "8698   I used a fancier, expensive department store brand blush for years.  I decided to try a cheaper option and landed on this one.  I liked it and thought it would be a great alternative.  However, my first one was purchased from a store and it broke into a million pieces after using maybe 20% of it.  I thought this was a fluke.  I ordered my second one from Amazon.  It arrived already smashed into pieces, which I blamed on shipping, and they kindly replaced it right away.  The new one arrived intact but then, like before, fell apart into unusable dust and crumbles after a few weeks.  It also spilled everywhere when I opened it, with some pieces falling onto my shirt and staining it.  At this point, I was obviously spending more money on a drug store blush than Chanel.  Overall, it was a terribly disappointing experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "9393   Now this review is going to be in two parts. The first part is going to be about how nice the product looks & feels on my skin. The second is going to be about the product's design & packaging.As advertised, this blush looks great on me. I chose this product because my powder compact matched one of the \"true matches\" for this color & since I'm not that skilled in picking out blushes, I liked that it was an easy choice. The product is easily blended & feels very light on my skin.Now for the bad part of the review. The packaging & design. It's horrible. I had to look to 2 stores before I found a blush compact where the powder wasn't smashed up. The first store's compacts had one that was physically damaged so I assumed that the powders were smashed up due to improper handling during transit. The 2nd store I went to had the blushes in both damaged & undamaged conditions. Again, I assumed this was due to improper handling during transit. I purchased my blush & went on about my life. Then when I returned home, the compact fell off of a very short coffee table to the ground, no more than 10 inches in height. It fell onto not only a padded carpet floor but also a nice thick rug on top of that floor, so it's not like it fell onto a hard surface. And guess what? The compact's powder was completely smashed up.The delicateness of the powder doesn't hurt the look of the makeup, but it does make it far less convenient for me to put on when I'm on the go. I also have to watch to ensure that I don't put too much on due to it being in a now loose powder form. (It's easy to get more on then you bargained for.) As a result I use it far less than I would have if it wasn't loose & I doubt that I'll purchase this again when this expires or runs out. Unless you treat your cosmetics like they're fragile children, I don't really recommend this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "9418   Edit:quite upset! I have had this product for a little while now, bust only used it a tops of FOUR TIMES. When I went to put it on today it shattered all over the bathroom sink! A total waste of money! One star rating for this.I just got the product. I went to the website of l'oreal for my skin tone. natural beige mineral powder was a LITTLE bit too light, so I bought sun beige mineral powder. It is too dark if I put too much, but perfect for a light coat. Due to this selection though, the website told me 'subtle stable' would be the perfect blush for my skin tone. So I bought it.I expected a darker blush, but it was lighter than I thought. It looked nice on me, I didnt feel like my cheeks were hot pink or looked rediculous, it looked how I imagine a natural blush should look. It is easy to make as light or dark as you want it to look which is nice. I will be using this in my makeup routine when I wear makeup from now on for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "9492   This is not a product suitable for oily skin or for someone with neutral skin.  After just a few hours, it turned incredibly orange on me.  Apricot Kiss was even a bit orange when I first applied it.  If you have normal or dry skin, then this may work for you.  Normally, powder blush works for my skin type, but when the product itself contains oil, bad things happen.  I've relegated this to my makeup drawer, where things I don't use go to die.  It seems a shame to throw it away when I've barely used it.  From now on, I've decided, I'm only buying makeup that I can return if it doesn't work for me (for whatever reason).  It's a waste of money to purchase drugstore makeup.  You can't test it out beforehand, so you very often end up with something totally unsuitable.  This includes everything from foundation and powder, to eyeshadow and lipstick.  My drawer is full of these rejects.  And when I think of all the money wasted, I'm upset that I could have bought some nicer items with the cash.  I'm sticking to Bare Minerals blush.  It's talc and oil free and the colors stay true throughout the day.  Yes, they're pricier, but for the aforementioned reasons, they're worth every penny.  No more Revlon, Maybelline, Cover Girl or Loreal.  Let people who don't mind wasting their cash buy these brands.  Except for mascara (because more expensive brands aren't any better) I'm leaving the drugstore counter to others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "9913   It is a good product....except for those who are allergic to Benzoyl peroxide or Salicylic acid. I didn’t In ow about this until I started using the product. On Day 1 I thought it was just some skin sensitivity to the humidity etc. Day 2, I noticed it was becoming very itchy and patchy on my forehead and cheek area (where I had applied this cream more liberally). Day 3 was beyond worst, I had big red hives and was really itchy and scratchy. I was bumped to not even able to use a collagen cream but was thankful that I could figure out the reason. I gave the cream (since it was brand new) to my MIL and she used it without any concerns/issues that I had to go through.So, I amNot very happy to give it 2 starts because it works for some people (like myMIL) but since it didn’t work on me, I wasn’t satisfied.

       "10118  This is a fake product ... the first time ,I got this product at shoppers store but they closed and I was going out of this. So I tcheked here and I found I was wondering with the price and some reviews weren’t good about this product but cos the original one I got from shoppers was soo great I gave this one a chance . So I bought 2 Wich the price of both was the half of the original product. But after 3 applications I could feel and see that those were fake and I had to just throw them in the trash . Please stop selling fake anti aging product to women usually we don’t need the cheap one we need the ORIGINAL ONE even if EXPENSIVE!!!! so since I’m looking for this at CVS and for now I’m using another original product from cvs by the time they gonna have this one cos this product if original it’s just a miracle !!!! Soo great and make you loook very younger in just 1 week .... but DO NOT BUY THIS FAKE ONE !!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "10842  I wanted to love this. I REALLY thought I would love this ... but I will never use nor recommend this product again! I have no idea why but this made my hyper pigmentation show up ten fold! I've been using TruSkin serums and my Holy Grail moisturizer ( Ponds Clarent B3 ) and my skin was radiant, clear , even and beautiful. Between the TruSkin Vit C and HA serums and my Moisturizer my skin was radiant and glowing and I had almost completely erased all the hyper pigmentation/ sun/ age spots and freckles. I get compliments on my skin and am often mistaken for being ten years younger then I am ( I'm 37 ) with relatively clear skin as in no break outs etc... the reason I tried this was I felt that with aging I might need a heavier cream to target my fine lines and wanted to try it since it was a filler. First I tried it twice a day... but it enlarged my pores and made my make up look ruddy. Then I tried it only at night ... and after a week straight my skin had completely lost the radiance and clarity I have spent over a year getting with my other holy grail products. I started noticing my hyper pigmentation coming back and it was even darker then originally! It was the craziest thing ever! I could even see it thru my foundation! I've never ever had a reaction like this to a product. I hate wasting money so I thought I'd try it as an eye cream at night... and really thought ... am I crazy ... this really can't be reversing all the benefits of my other products right? After 3 days of using it as an eye cream I have DARK circles under my eyes right where I applied it and what looks like Melesma ( and I am not pregnant!) I AM SO DISAPPOINTED! I even went so far as writing the company I get my TruSkin Naturals products from to see if she had ever heard of anyone having a reaction from a collagen based product that might counteract the effects of what is in their products and she had never heard of this and said many women use collagen products with their products and never had a problem. There has to be something in this that reacts to my skin cause I am at a loss and am so bummed! As far as how it felt and smelled... like I said I wanted to love it and thought I would... I loved how it smelled even tho for some who don't like fragrance it might be strong and the consistency is very rich yet feels almost between a gel and a cream and a little goes a long way. Feels good on the skin, it really did, but their is no way I would ever use it again. It has gone in the trash! Never been so disappointed with a product in my life. I'd rather it have not worked at all then completely reverse all the amazing benefits I had with my other products. I should've left well enough alone! 😕                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "12009  I purchased this item on 02/02/19 and recieved it 02/08/19. It came in perfect condition wrapped in bubble wrap and placed in a vanilla envelope. I was concerned because it wasnt labeled as fragile. I tried this foundation in a different ways. First I tried it as a coverage foundation but it was too sheer and it didnt cover anything or fix and natural color blemishes of my face. (I'd like to mention that I did choose a shade way too light).I cleamed that off and used the last bit of my almay foundation and used this to highlight. That worked out pretty well and even though I didnt love it, I could definitely work with it.What ruined the look was when I used the loreal trumatch powder and it made my whole face cakey and really defined my pores.I asked my husband how the make up looked and his exact words were \"It looks like you got old...QUICK\"I dont recommend this product and I am disappointed.I'll give 2 stars for the packaging and the highlighting effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "12213  Just not a fan at all, I used to switch up mascara a lot from high end department stores and ended up always going back to my cheapy fav, covergirl Lashblast (the green \"extensions\" and the original orange volume are the best!). I had a coupon for L'Oreal mascara so I decided to try the Voluminous Original Mascara... what a let down. I gave it a two star because once out of 5 or 6 times, it did look pretty good. The rest were a hot clumpy mess, the mascara is way too wet and the brush does nothing to help with clumps. The worse part is the raccoon eyes that happened every time around mid day, keep it mind it's mid October and I have a desk job, i'm in no way too warm that would give a tiny excuse to raccoon eyes. I chucked this one the second I came home and then went and ordered 3 of the lashblast that I love, atleast this mascara made me realize not to try to fix something that isn't broken....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "12236  Update:  I have since moved back to my trusty HG Japanese mascara. This is a good mascara but in the end, it's not truly waterproof because by midday, I have mascara smudges which never happens with my HG.  Sorry to be moving this from 4 stars to 2 stars.  I also have started using a different a oil cleanser and it works great at removing super waterproof mascara.I have stick straight lashes that don't keep a curl, meaning I have to use waterproof mascara in order to hold a curl. For years I've been using a Japanese brand of mascara which I really like but removing it at the end of the day has become labor intensive.  Although I use an oil cleanser which takes off all other makeup very easily, the Japanese waterproof mascara refuses to be washed off completely. Enter L'Oreal Voluminous waterproof mascara -- easy to apply, no clumps, maintains the curl, deposits a dark coat, and best of all, easily removed with my oil cleanser.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it gave my lashes more volume than it claims despite putting two coats, but this will be my mascara going forward and am happy I won't have to pay a hefty price at a specialty store for the Japanese brand.

       "12247  Why won't I learn!!! After trying so many other \"wonder\" mascaras out there and being disappointed time and time again, this mascara came back to mind. I remembered I wasn't thrilled with it in the past, but I thought that maybe, juuuust maybe they had improved upon it within the many, many years it's been on the market...but, I was wrong...waaaaay wrong!!!! This mascara performed just as I had remembered it eons ago!!! UGH!!! I guess the creamy texture is what my mind was craving since all of the mascaras I have tried recently have made my eyelashes \"crunchy\"...but I think it's that very same creamy texture that make this particular mascara smudge and smear and end up completely off my lashes and under my eyes within an hour of applying!! Horrible!!!! I look like I've had no sleep and exhausted...I look sick and unkempt!!! YIKES!!! Welp!! No more!!! This time I have learned!!! This one goes in the \"Never Again\" column!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "12252  I am not sure what is going on... I've ordered \"L’Oreal Paris Makeup Voluminous Original Volume Building Mascara, Deep Burgundy\" about a month ago. Loved the color and how it looked. I used it couple of times and it was OK except little discomfort at the end of day. One day during drive to NY from Boston my eyes started to heart and feel sandy. By the time we got to NY I had a severe case of pink eye. I thought it could be that something got in to the mascara and spoiled it so I tossed it away. Since I loved the color, ordered another one and what do you know, after first use same thing happened. I am not sure if it is allergic reaction or conjunctivitis . It goes away in couple of days. I never had any allergies before but i am not a heavy makeup user. Also, I only had  conjunctivitis in my whole life twice and twice in one month right after using this particular mascara. So people with sensitive eyes -- beware!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "75155  Over the years I have had the opportunity to use quite a few different clay products and facial cleansers.  The idea of this product intrigued me.  However, it just did not perform as I expected.WHAT IS THIS CLEANSER LIKE?This cleanser is a green color, which would lead me to expect that it would have a fresh natural fragrance.  I also would expect it to have a natural fresh feeling.  It comes in a squeeze tube which dispenses little squiggles of cleanser so you won't end up with too much accidentally.  The cleanser has a very pungent smell, I would say that it is cloying and overbearing.HOW DOES THIS CLEANSER WORK?What you do is wet your face.  Then you put on the cleanser after rubbing it between wet hands so it becomes a \"mousse\".  You smear it all over your face and massage it for a bit and then rinse off.  The product claims that it is not too drying.  It also claims to clean and brighten too.MY EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CLEANSERCONTENTS AND SCENTFirst of all, I was very surprised to find that this cleanser has sodium lauryl sulfate in it.  That is a high foaming de-greaser which I tend to avoid in most products.  It is not what I would expect in a clay based cleanser.  The smell was overbearing- on the edge of nauseating to me, and I found myself not wanting to smell it anymore, even after it had been rinsed away a while.DOES IT DRY SKIN?Contrary to the claims, the sodium lauryl sulfate which tends to be harsh on the skin was not offset by the glycerine in the product which is supposed to moisturize the face.  I felt that it made my skin too tight and I did not like the feeling.  I have normal skin this time of year.THE BOTTOM LINEI really did not like this cleanser.  It stripped my skin too much, smelled overbearing which made me want to not use it, and I felt that it just did not turn out to be as \"natural\" as I expected it to be.  I usually reserve 1 star for products that I absolutely hate, but I have a hard time giving this two stars.  So, this is a 1 star rating.If they had given it a natural fresh scent and left out the sodium lauryl sulfate, this could have been a nicer product.  As it is, I just found it overbearing and not anything I would want to use again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "75244  Update: After using this for a time, I have come to dislike it immensely! First, the scent is too “cheap men’s cologne.” Secondly, it is SO messy! No matter how much I try to lather all of it, some will drop to the shower tub floor and leave little globs there—and if I don’t catch it all, it dries and is difficult to remove. UGH! I finally just tossed this stuff. Lowering my stars to 3 thought I thought of making it 2 stars. But I’ll leave my initial review anyway since I did like the cleanser otherwise—at least at first.————The scent: - way too overpowering. But at least it’s not flowery.How: This is a clay-like lotion. Dark green in color that you rub your hands/fingers together to create the mousse-like cream to apply. It's thick when you squeeze it out, but turns into a lighter substance once your rub your hands/fingers together. Applying to the face it's gentle and smooth. Quite nice! Feels wonderful.The cleansing: I love that this isn't a too sudsy face cleanser. I do have those, and I will use them from time to time, but this cleanser goes on smoothly and washes away quickly and cleanly.The price: Here, I have a cleanser that is just as nice as salon product but for a fraction of the cost. Amazon price is at $5.99 at time of this review.I'm happy with this clay cleanser.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "75336  I am 70 years old.  Since adolescence my skin has been extremely oily and over the years the pores on the sides of my nose have become enlarged.  I do not have fine wrinkles - I do have smile lines and acne scars on the sides of my chin, though. I'm always on the lookout for products that will clean, exfoliate and refine pores. This cleanser, used as directed, did not clean my skin as well as I would like  It did not exfoliate well, either. I used it daily for 6 weeks. It left me feeling that my face was not clean, and it became shiny sooner after washing than with other mild cleansers (Olay for sensitive skin, for example)  I think the current \"clay\" drama may be just another multi-product fad.Here are some items (not cleansers) found on Amazon that have made a significant difference in the texture of my skin, reduced the oiliness and refined my pores, especially: \\n\\n  \\nToLB Anti Aging Serum Combo Pack - 98% Natural, 72% ORGANIC - Vitamin C Serum - Retinol Serum - Hyaluronic Acid Serum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "75576  I bought this many, many months ago. I had decided I would wait awhile to do a review after using it just so I could tell about long-term use. Honestly, it has done absolutely NOTHING!! It's not a cleanser, it is a toner. It hasn't made my skin brighter, softer, dryer, less red...nothing. It hasn't made me breakout, nothing. I've read the bottle and what it's benefits are supposed to be and honestly I'm still not 100% sure exactly what I'm supposed to see happen to my skin but since I've been using it for about 3 months and I've seen no change in my skin I guess it doesn't matter. This is the first time I've ever used toner of any kind, I just thought I'd give it a try, but I will never buy toner again. And honestly, because it was so cheap I had bought some for my mother and two sisters also and they've been using it as long as I have and it has done nothing for their skin either. Pointless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "75670  This was a great product for me the first 2 weeks. I have oily combination skin and it was getting worse as I was from Colorado and started going to school in Georgia. So when I read the reviews I was sure this product would be fine. It worked and felt really nice at first and I would use it as instructed in the morning and afternoon. After a week I started to notice that my skin would feel burning when I would apply my moisturizer (as I always do). I couldn't figure if the problem was this or my Simple Micellenar Water thing so I switched to find out. I started using this once a day and it got a little better. But I found that the Simple Micellenar felt better so I eventually decided to stop using this product. Even after stopping it took about 2 months for my skin to stop feeling the burning sensation when moisturizing and for it to return to normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "76239  I’ve used self tanners for MANY years. They all smell bad and they’re sticky but some are better than others.  These are not better.  Still, I always put the stuff on before bed and wake up and take a shower so it’s not a big deal.  What IS a big deal is that I’ve never had a problem with streaking until now!  I have a performance tonight and I’ve got white stripes all up and down my arms and legs!  AAAUGH!  I’ve used towelettes before but a different brand.  I got them in one of the new beauty tubes but those were obviously a much better product so it isn’t as though I’ve never used towelettes for tanning.  In other words, I know how to do this.I admit I didn’t buy this from Amazon.  I bought it from a drugstore and they were very fresh.  I just wanted to leave a review where people could see it.  I don’t understand all of these positive reviews.  It’s quicker to just slather on the tanner than to use these.  They dry out quickly so if you are doing arms, legs, face, and you start at the top, it will dry out on your first leg.  So you will need two per session and you will still streak.Even if it didn’t streak, $8 for three sessions is not worth the money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "76245  Okay do I really like these in theory. In reality, however, not as great as I had hoped. The towel is a good size, actually large enough to reasonably cover your body, dries pretty instantly and the formula doesn’t smell that bad (like many fake tanning products do).The biggest issue I have is that the towel is white and the formula goes on clear, so it doesn’t leave a trace of where you have used it. You would think this is a good thing. It is not. This makes it so that you cannot tell at all where you have used it, where you have not, where needs more, etc. The result is a streaky finish and uneven tan. I thought maybe the first time I used them I had a learning curve so I gave it another try and….same thing. This could totally be user error on my part but I think this could be improved immensely by giving some trace of where it has been applied. All in all, I do think the color it gives is really nice and lasts a good amount of time compared to similar products. Not a win for me personally, I won’t be buying these in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "76247  Ok...at first when I was going to write my review, I was going to give it 1 star because it left a few very noticeable streaks on my legs. Then I decided to try it again and absolutely no more streaks on my legs. My legs are streak free and the tan is even all the way around and they look great. Just like a real suntan.Now having said that, once this starts to wear off, it makes you itch like crazy!!!  When it's starting to wear off it leaves like cracks from the tan and whoa do you begin to itch! Oh my god. I lhave scratch marks all over my legs. arms , and stomach from scratching so much. I must be allergic to it. So if you have sensitive skin, I would stay away from this product.I exfoliated to try to remove this faster but I had to wait until it faded on its own. Once the tan was completely gone, the itching stopped,I wouldn't recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "76274  I bought these towelettes at my local drug store, hoping to get some color before my vacation. Luckily, I only applied it on my legs and I have a couple weeks for it to wear off before I leave. As another reviewer said, it leaves streaks and it gives the skin an unnatural, orangish color. You don't notice at first as it takes a couple hours for the color to start working.  When I first applied it, I noticed the streaks the next day. I applied more to see if I could blend it but, again, more streaks. Not only that but it has a chemical smell that they try to mask with citrus but it still smells bad.Also, there are no instructions on how to apply the wipes. It doesn't say to wipe in a circular motion and I had to search on YouTube to find out. Still, I won't continue with this product as the color is bad, steaks or no streaks.If you insist on trying these, here's some advice: First, use gloves. You do not want to touch other parts of your body when applying this. Second, apply well in advance before your special event or vacation. If you don't like it, then you'll have some time for it to fade. Third, don't put this on your face!After trying these wipes, I'm convinced there s no self-tanning product that is worth buying. I'll just stick to getting my color the old-fashioned way (with sunscreen of course).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "76314  I don't think we need a picture, when you can imagine what a giraffe looks like. I'm very light-skinned and this did not go according to plan. I moisturized, exfoliated, moisturized again In typically dry areas like knees and ankles…Watched a YouTube video and read the instructions on the box as well, just to make sure I didn't end up looking orange and streaky like I did as a teenager.Somehow, I still managed to miss a few spots which I noticed in the morning. Glowing white knees and white patches on my feet. The very areas they tell you to add a light moisturizer so too much of the product doesn't stick. So I figure just touch it up… It got worse.Apparently I exfoliated too much because no remedy to remove this tanner has worked. It's perfect that it's 90° outside and I will be forced to wear pants and socks, until a new layer of skin grows. Additionally it was pretty orange and did not smell good. So in summary, I'm going to not recommend this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "76599  I love a tan & usually start my summer with help from self-tanners, but always used the lotions.  After reading the reviews, I figured I'd give these towelettes a try.  Last night, I exfoliated, shaved and followed the instructions to the letter.  I then applied on my legs, chest & arms. I immediately detected a very strong perfumy/self-tanner odor, but honestly if it worked, I would have been fine with it.  Next morning, I gave myself a once over and it didn't look half bad.  Then I remembered a few reviews stating that what looked fine inside was a different story in true sunlight.  Well the same thing happened with me.  Not bad inside, but standing in the natural sun it was very easy to see horrible streaks & blotchy color all over the place.  Like I said, I've successfully used self-tanners before but never a towelette.  And I never will again.  I really hate wasting money, but will be throwing the whole box in the trash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "76615  I truly don't know how this has the majority of 5 stars. I purchased these and I thought they were a bit pricy for only 6 tanning wipes, considering it took 2 to cover your entire body. They go on as clear, which made it difficult to know where you already wiped. The next day I woke up streaked and orange. It looked like I had slapped the wipe on random parts of my body. I tried, again that night. Woke up the next day and even more streaks and brighter orange! So the final night ( the last of my wipes ) tried again. Same thing. Extremely streaked and it's about as orange as the package. That wasn't the end. It lasted about a week. I looked like I had a skin disease. My skin looked like a cows skin, except it was tan (my skin color) and orange! I had people staring at me in public. It eventually looked like dirt that wouldn't come off. I had to stay in for days. I do not recommend this product what so ever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "76623  I usually go into these reviews with at least a partial sense that I am subject to committing user error. In this case, I can't lay fault completely to the product, but I will say that the biggest problems were not caused by me.First, the product does not anywhere say that someone with light skin couldn't not use it. As it is the medium and not the dark, I thought I was safe. Wrong.Next, it doesn't have any suggestions for HOW to apply the color. That would be helpful. I read around that I should use circular motions, and when I got to it, I forgot and didn't at all. That was definitely my fault. Straight up and down motions cause streaks. And boy did I get streaks.The worst part is that I am seriously orange. And the box says you will see results within \"less than an hour.\" No way. When I went to bed (read: when I might have still had some time to correct things) it all looked good aside from one streak on my thigh. When I woke up I seriously gasped! My feet are orange, my legs are orange and streaky, and I still smell HORRIBLE from the \"citrus scent,\" which is actually only citrus when you are first putting it on. Now about 12 hours later I am still smelling like self tanner and I am lucky I don't have to leave the house today.I didn't purchase this from amazon, but felt that I'd like to share the review for those (like me) that come here first to check things out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "77318  I use this product as directed, on well cleansed skin that was damp. I used only half of the vial. I have no idea what is in this vial but it's horrible! First of all, the vial design is ridiculous. The product gets caught in the top and all that flicking doesn't help it migrated to the bottom. So you're probably losing about a third of the product in the top of the vial and that's just bad business. The second issue was trying to measure out 1/2 of the product from the vial. I am lucky that I have some empty cleaned droppers that I could suck the fluid out and measure it correctly. The biggest problem was the fluid itself. It was very tacky going on and it dried like an egg mask. It made my skin extremely tight and I noticed that certain areas like under my eyes or around my mouth were actually wrinkling worse as the product was drying. I immediately rinsed my face, thinking I might have used too much or that my face wasn't damp enough. I wasted another ampule, opening it up and putting it on my wet face. Again, as the solution was drying, I felt it tightening my skin in a way that wasn't pleasant feeling and was not aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Again it made the fine lines in my face look like wrinkles. I looked older after I use the product then with a freshly cleansed naked face. I don't know if this product batch was defective but I will not be buying it again and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone that I know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "77326  I don't usually write reviews but I do hope that I can help a few people with this. I used to use this stuff and fell in love with it. At first it worked very well but as I got to the last of my 2nd bottle I started breaking out like crazy. I don't know much about skincare or what ingredients you should be looking for except that I knew hyaluronic acid is an extreme moisturizing ingredient that my skin needed which is why I bought this.  I found out (from experts in skin care) that this product could of been the cause of my breakouts because it uses the ingredient hydroxyethylpiperazine ethane sulfonic acid as a buffering agent which this agent is one of the worse buffering agents to use. hyaluronic acid is known for its moisturizing effects because it takes moisture from the air and holds that moisture in your skin. Suflonic acid (buffering agent) pulls everything in the air with the moisture, for instance, pollution, UV, sunlight, and other molecules that are damaging to your skin. What is scary is that we don't see the damage until a while down the road therefore at first this was great as it secretly damaged my skin, extremely. I went through 2 bottles. Now that I have changed serums to IUNIK Black Snail, correctly on my 3rd. My skin has finally calmed down (which took about a month or so) and I haven't had a further reaction, confirming that this product was the cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "78260  I bought this product because it had so many great reviews and many were touting that it doesn't have an orange hue to it.  I really think it depends on your skin tone.  I applied it once and it definitely has the orange hue.  I have a lighter olive complexion and I think the combo makes my skin now appear that subtle orange.  I'm really glad that it will fade...but just be warned.  I think this product only looks a certain way with certain complexions.The product was really easy to apply overall but because it is so watery, it is really easy to have accumulated areas in creases and whatnot.  You can definitely take a washcloth and scrub those areas the next day if needed.The worst part about this product, however, isn't even the fact that it turns orange on my kind of skin, but the smell.  It is really pleasant at first but as it develops it definitely smells like the regular self tanners.Unfortunately this product is a no for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "78385  I thought that it was crazy that a clear product could make you look tan. It does give you a bronze tan color,....but. Of course there is a but. The first day my daughter put about 3 coats on but it was very uneven. I told her it looked like she had vitiligo, very splotchy. The rough spots like knees, ankles, elbows and hands were very fake gross looking. I had read from other reviews for people to put lotion on the dry spots before allying.So I told her to wait a few days for it to fade and I would help her out. I had her put lotion on her knees, elbows, ankles and knuckles first. So I out gloves on so my hands wouldn't be funky the next day. Make sure you put some plactis wrap on the counter before you use the bottle and get it all greasy, along with the floor. So I used the gloves, each pump a different part, such as I started with the arms one by one, completely covering them, You can easily tell where you put it because it has a wet look. It takes a LONG time to dry. You pretty much stand there in front of a fan for at least 15 minutes. I tried it on myself also and it was a gross sticky feeling the whole time I had it on. The smell is ok but I kind of drives you nuts after awhile. You have to make sure I you go in your car to put a towel on the seat bottom and back. You have to let it sit at least 4 hours to get some color. You do get a nice color, but even when I applied it very evenly to her, it still wasn't fully even and had odd splotches and spots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "78753  I thought this was a treatment product for the sensitive eye area, but it's really more like make-up.  It's not exactly concealer, nor is it a primer or highlighter.  It reminds me very much of a product that was popular back in the 1980's - Glowtion by Ultima II.  Is anyone old enough to remember their ads with Cybill Shepherd?Anyhow, this is a sheer peachy/rosy toned cream that is being marketed as a brightener for the skin around the eyes.  Because I have very dark circles (entirely encircling my eyes), I was hopeful [yet skeptical] that it would make any improvement.  Unfortunately, because it's much more sheer than an actual concealer, the reduction in the appearance of my dark circles was extremely minimal.  I did notice a slight rosy glow to the area, which only made me realize the product would probably work better as a substitute for blush and/or highlighter on the cheekbones, rather than under the eyes.Overall, a disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "78957  What a disappointment and waste of money. I had purchased a different formula of this mascara at drug store. The one I purchased had the same wand which is why I wanted to try it. I loved the wand and the mascara. Needing to get more I found this on Amazon yeah.. NOT!this is a different formula than the one I had initially purchased. I wanted to try the waterproof version.It was a bit higher in price but I loved the other one so much I thought it would be worth the extra cost.After waiting for it to arrive because of a backorder. I finally got it! Tried it right out of the box. What a disappointment 😣 the first coat you couldn't even tell I had mascara on. I tried coat after coat and no coverage. It did absolutely nothing. Almost as if there was clear mascara in there. So I wiped the wand with a tissue and it was black. I tried again.. Same thing. I had to back and use my old standby.I have been using Loreal mascara for many many years and have never been so disappointed in a product.Total waste of money.I will buy the original formula from now on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "79195  I don't hate this mascara, but I don't like it either. So you know where I'm coming from, I have naturally very long thin eyelashes with blonde tips. What I generally look for from a mascara is definition, colour and if possible thickness, I prefer short spiky brushes that comb and define my lashes, getting every part of them. If your needs are definition and colour and you have similar lashes, this mascara is not for you.First let's talk about the gimmick; the bendable wand. It's a cool idea, immediately I thought 'oh yay, I can get those tricky corner lashes', but it didn't work well. I practiced and practiced, but no matter how many times I applied, it just felt totally awkward, tickled my lashes and I ended up smudging it all over my face. The formula smudges very easily so if you make even a little mistake, it's a big clean-up job. It also promises lift, but my eyelashes (uncurled) actually went down more than anything, they weren't lifted at all.The other thing about the formula is that it's not clumpy, but it leaves your lashes really spidery, even after combing and I'm not a fan of that look. The straight brush worked better, but this just isn't a mascara that worked well with my lash type, so I wouldn't use it again. I thought the black colour was very nice and dark, but I didn't like the formula consistency, brush, or finished effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "79412  I got the color Bittersweet and it's a great grey-ed out chocolate brown on me and does genuinely smell like chocolate, but I cannot stand the formula of this lipstick. It's super thick like a mousse, feels thick and heavy going on and takes forever to dry down even with a thin layer. And even then it remains vaguely tacky like I have glue or something on my lips unless I take it off. It's gross.Also, it's a nightmare to get off! I wear one of the most bulletproof mascaras ever (Kiss Me Heroine) that will literally stand up in the ocean and when I'm dripping sweat while working outside in the dead of summer without budging (and I mean that, I've worn it in those instances multiple times). My cleansing oil will take that mascara right off with a little light massaging. This lipstick? It took THREE rounds of my cleansing oil to get it off and I was practically scrubbing with a damn cotton pad the last time.Loreal needs to re-evaluate the formula on these things or something because it's terrible right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "80625  I'm on the sallow end of the scale, and always have been, even as a child.  It has nothing to do with \"dead cells,\" as the blurb would have you believe.  I exfoliate religiously and there are no dead cells on my skin, but I\"m still pale and yellowish.  So I decided to try this to perk up my coloration a bit, because I'm afraid that if I fall asleep, my grands will think I'm dead and bury me.First of all, this is not an easy product to find.  I went to five places before I found it.My experience:This is the first item I've bought in years that comes in a jar instead of a pumper bottle or tube.  So the first time my clean finger touched it, it was contaminated.  I use a coffee stirrer to scoop it out of the jar.  Don't buy products that come in jars!It's quite thick and stiff, so before applying, I rub my hands together for a few seconds to warm it up and hopefully make it more spreadable.  Doesn't work.  So I'm rubbing and pulling on my skin while applying.  Major no-no.Despite being so thick, it's not emollient enough for me.  So I'm doing a double application:  apply it, wait five minutes for it to absorb, and reapply.It's fragranced.  Booooo.It does't impart much color.  And that's what I bought it for.The price is right, compared to other toiletries, but ultimately, it's not worth it and I won't buy it again.  I don't hate it, and it's not ruining my skin, but... no thanks.The only reason I'm not pitching it out is that I'm too cheap.  So I'll use it up and that'll be it for this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "80941  I compared two rose tinted skin creams, putting them each on one half of my face for a about two weeks.1. Neutrogena Bright Boost Gel Cream, Brightening Face Moisturizer: https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B081DJ199F2. L'Oreal Paris Face Moisturizer Age Perfect Renewal Tinted Rosy Tone Day Cream:https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01M09QQI0Note: I do not expect to see cumulative results so I am providing this review after only two weeks.  If I see any improvement from ongoing use of either product, I'll update this review.I don't buy into the face cream hype, so my expectations were low:  simply that the cream would make my face look a bit pink, would make my face feel moisturized, and that it would have a pleasant scent.I think of these rosy creams as more of a cosmetic than a skin boosting cream – something that will make a visible difference in the moment and wash off after, without any long-term impact.  However, neither creates a lasting or even temporary change in skin tone tone (I'm fair and it would definitely show).  The Neutrogena feels like a base to put makeup over because it seems to create a smooth surface.  My face didn't feel any more moisturized after use but I like how it feels a bit tight and dry to the touch.  The L’Oreal feels a bit oily throughout the day.The L'Oreal has a mild scent that smells a bit like an old lady. The Neutrogena has a mild, slightly floral scent.The L’Oreal goes on fairly thick and and absorbs into the skin faster than the Neutrogena.  It has a matte tone to it and although other reviewers comment on sparkles, I didn’t see any in my 10X magnifying mirror. The Neutrogena feels nice on the skin and has a pearly iridescence.  It's a bit on the runny side (I don’t know why it’s called a “gel”). There are tiny sparkle flecks (you can see them in a 10x magnifying mirror) which may help with the claim for \"brightness\".Overall, my skin seems a bit smoother than on the side that I used Neutrogena on.  It’s not enough to say there’s a noticeable difference between the two products.The Neutrogena marketing claims the cream boosts cell turnover by 10 times - but how do you even know that?  The L'Oreal marketing language is less extreme and more believable.The results are subjective, but I think my skin looks marginally brighter on the Neutrogena half of my face and it goes on light.  Overall, I preferred the Neutrogena to the L'Oreal product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "81535  UPDATE: I'm dropping this down to 2 stars now that I've had it for a few weeks because it doesn't moisturize nearly as well as I need it to (or as well as my other products). I'm 46 so my skin is becoming more demanding, and this product strikes me as almost a little bit clay-like, both in scent and in the way it sits on top of my skin. Problem is I need my moisturizer to sink in deep so my skin won't tug when I smile (etc), and this one doesn't do the trick. When I finally put some of my old moisturizer on after a few weeks of this one, the difference was incredible.It's thicker than most day creams and feels almost a tiny bit clay-like as it goes on, but doesn't look too artificial or interfere with my makeup so I suppose it does no harm. It's listed as \"unscented\" (which I appreciate), and there's only the faintest bit of a clay-like scent. I appreciate that they didn't cover it up with something worse, although it's not my favorite either (I prefer relatively natural scents you get from some moisturizing oils in their natural state). But again, it doesn't work well enough for my aging skin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "81774  This product was great for about 2 days. In those first 2 days my skin looked fantastic, smoother and had a great color tone, I thought I'd found the holy grail.  Then it all went down hill.  By the 3rd day the \"rosy\" tone was way too pink, almost ruddy. I started to notice dryness in some places and very clogged blackheads in other places, so clogged that my skin felt rough on the surface. By the 4th day I had a lot of white heads forming and a breakout.  I read all these positive reviews and really do not know what skin type one has to have in order for this cream to work.  For what it's worth, I'm 43, I have moderately fair, combination skin, that is tending toward being more dry in the last couple years. I usually only experience hormone related breakout once a month or when using a particular product. I don't wear foundation so this cream did not \"interact\" with any other product on my skin. This product does have a scent that is stronger than I expected for a face cream, and while I didn't think it was overpowering per se, I didn't particularly like the scent either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "82289  I don't usually write reviews but I do hope that I can help a few people with this. I used to use this stuff and fell in love with it. At first it worked very well but as I got to the last of my 2nd bottle I started breaking out like crazy. I don't know much about skincare or what ingredients you should be looking for except that I knew hyaluronic acid is an extreme moisturizing ingredient that my skin needed which is why I bought this.  I found out (from experts in skin care) that this product could of been the cause of my breakouts because it uses the ingredient hydroxyethylpiperazine ethane sulfonic acid as a buffering agent which this agent is one of the worse buffering agents to use. hyaluronic acid is known for its moisturizing effects because it takes moisture from the air and holds that moisture in your skin. Suflonic acid (buffering agent) pulls everything in the air with the moisture, for instance, pollution, UV, sunlight, and other molecules that are damaging to your skin. What is scary is that we don't see the damage until a while down the road therefore at first this was great as it secretly damaged my skin, extremely. I went through 2 bottles. Now that I have changed serums to IUNIK Black Snail, correctly on my 3rd. My skin has finally calmed down (which took about a month or so) and I haven't had a further reaction, confirming that this product was the cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "82329  I use this product as directed, on well cleansed skin that was damp. I used only half of the vial. I have no idea what is in this vial but it's horrible! First of all, the vial design is ridiculous. The product gets caught in the top and all that flicking doesn't help it migrated to the bottom. So you're probably losing about a third of the product in the top of the vial and that's just bad business. The second issue was trying to measure out 1/2 of the product from the vial. I am lucky that I have some empty cleaned droppers that I could suck the fluid out and measure it correctly. The biggest problem was the fluid itself. It was very tacky going on and it dried like an egg mask. It made my skin extremely tight and I noticed that certain areas like under my eyes or around my mouth were actually wrinkling worse as the product was drying. I immediately rinsed my face, thinking I might have used too much or that my face wasn't damp enough. I wasted another ampule, opening it up and putting it on my wet face. Again, as the solution was drying, I felt it tightening my skin in a way that wasn't pleasant feeling and was not aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Again it made the fine lines in my face look like wrinkles. I looked older after I use the product then with a freshly cleansed naked face. I don't know if this product batch was defective but I will not be buying it again and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone that I know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Why?? It’s horrible for skin. It has sunscreen to protect from UV, yet it’s not protecting skin from known irritants. One doesn’t need to feel irritation for it to be occurring. So this is three stars knocked off- it’s just unacceptable when there are SO many different options of all different price points that do not contain alcohol denatured.Otherwise, I’ll keep two stars because it has sun protection, SPF 50.  I can’t recommend this :(                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "83737  I don't usually write reviews but I do hope that I can help a few people with this. I used to use this stuff and fell in love with it. At first it worked very well but as I got to the last of my 2nd bottle I started breaking out like crazy. I don't know much about skincare or what ingredients you should be looking for except that I knew hyaluronic acid is an extreme moisturizing ingredient that my skin needed which is why I bought this.  I found out (from experts in skin care) that this product could of been the cause of my breakouts because it uses the ingredient hydroxyethylpiperazine ethane sulfonic acid as a buffering agent which this agent is one of the worse buffering agents to use. hyaluronic acid is known for its moisturizing effects because it takes moisture from the air and holds that moisture in your skin. Suflonic acid (buffering agent) pulls everything in the air with the moisture, for instance, pollution, UV, sunlight, and other molecules that are damaging to your skin. What is scary is that we don't see the damage until a while down the road therefore at first this was great as it secretly damaged my skin, extremely. I went through 2 bottles. Now that I have changed serums to IUNIK Black Snail, correctly on my 3rd. My skin has finally calmed down (which took about a month or so) and I haven't had a further reaction, confirming that this product was the cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "83777  I use this product as directed, on well cleansed skin that was damp. I used only half of the vial. I have no idea what is in this vial but it's horrible! First of all, the vial design is ridiculous. The product gets caught in the top and all that flicking doesn't help it migrated to the bottom. So you're probably losing about a third of the product in the top of the vial and that's just bad business. The second issue was trying to measure out 1/2 of the product from the vial. I am lucky that I have some empty cleaned droppers that I could suck the fluid out and measure it correctly. The biggest problem was the fluid itself. It was very tacky going on and it dried like an egg mask. It made my skin extremely tight and I noticed that certain areas like under my eyes or around my mouth were actually wrinkling worse as the product was drying. I immediately rinsed my face, thinking I might have used too much or that my face wasn't damp enough. I wasted another ampule, opening it up and putting it on my wet face. Again, as the solution was drying, I felt it tightening my skin in a way that wasn't pleasant feeling and was not aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Again it made the fine lines in my face look like wrinkles. I looked older after I use the product then with a freshly cleansed naked face. I don't know if this product batch was defective but I will not be buying it again and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone that I know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

I had managed a thin line that complemented my eyes.  I was very pleased and got myself together to leave for the store.  Thanks heavens I looked in the hallway mirror before I went out the door because my eyes were definitely not understated at that point.  In just a little while I had gone from looking nice to looking like I was going to either a Halloween party or a Goth festival.  The liner had faded around my lash line but spread to my upper lids and under my eyes.  I don't have oily lids and I had put on a primer with a light tan eyeshadow.  I have never had a liner run this bad, especially in the time it took for me to go from upstairs to downstairs, feed the dog, and put on my coat.  I know most of the reviews on this product are positive but my experience definitely wasn't.  I don't know why, I just know that this was the worst eyeliner experience I have had since I started wearing makeup in my teens.  I did try using it again but had pretty much the same experience so tossed it.  I now use Physician's Formula Eye Booster 2 in 1.

It said nothing about my other skin problems (large pores, oily skin, acne) but figured it might help with the wrinkles. I was able to try these products for free from Loreal and I did so for two weeks. My first impression was not good. The products seemed to make my skin more red than usual and left a sticky, tacky feel behind. I figured the redness was because it was new and my skin would need to adjust. This did not go away as time progressed however and actually got worse as I started breaking out pretty bad from the products. I pushed through though since I wanted to give it a full two weeks but at the end nothing changed and I was still red and acne ridden. Also, I do not feel it did anything for my wrinkles. The product claims that within 1-2 weeks you would notice a change in fine lines and wrinkles but I did not. My face remained the same for those two issues. As far as the brightness part of the product I can't really write to that. My skin doesn't have dullness and is always bright and shiny with oil so I'm probably the wrong person for that aspect of this product line. Overall I would definitely not recommend this product line to anyone with oily or acne prone skin. If you have rosacea you will become more red most likely so stay away if you have that too. I went back in my normal routine after two weeks of using the Loreal line and my skin is back to normal with minimal redness and acne.  For the astringent pads in particular I did not like anything about them. They left my face feeling sticky and didn't seem to really do anything or my skin. They do contain alcohol denat. which could be the main culprit of making my skin so red and acne ridden. I'm not sure if it was one or all products that caused redness so that is why I am rating this product so low. In the pictures the before is on the right and bottom of the comparison shots.</td>\n",

The consistency of the concealer seems very thin compared to that of the old container, and the applicator has changed from a blotter/dabber to a brush. The new container doesn't contain the concealer. It is EVERYWHERE. It is oozing out of the lid every time I open and close the bottle. If I don't store it upright (like when I am traveling) it is even worse. The concealer itself doesn't seem as good, its thinner in color and not as dense with easy coverage. I am disappointed because I wear the Fair/Cool color and there's not much else out there that matches as well in color as this does.</td>\n",

Waste of money as I will not be using it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3      Gave me the worst breakout I have EVER had in my life! I used the Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water to wash my face one night, and when I woke up the next morning.....There were these little bumps “and” little white pimples EVERYWHERE—All Over My Face & Even on Some Areas of My Neck!Terrible product for something advertised as being non-comedogenic and “safe enough to use day and night.” Also, the bottles even says “no need to rinse.”I don’t know WHO this product was tested on, but obviously not anyone with sensitive skin and/or prone to breakouts!If they had, they would CLEARLY SEE that this product is NOT for “everyone” as we are led to believe by the product’s labeling! Complete waste of money! I do NOT recommend it!I really wish I could have given this product a better review because I was excited about using it, and had high hopes for the product!Considering it initially appeared (and was advertised) as an alternative to the usual (ingredients by the dozens) facial cleansing products, I thought I found something great!Unfortunately, my initial opinions/observations of this product were completely wrong, and to hopefully save others the same disaster, I am sharing my experience in using this product.My review is “NEGATIVE” considering I ended up with the WORST Breakout of My Life (no exaggeration whatsoever) that (HONESTLY) took about 2 1/2 weeks to calm down!I actually STILL have a few lingering areas that I’m trying to get the blemishes to heal (and disappear) after using the product just ONCE!Be careful with this product if you decide to try it! Be very careful!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "4      Good at removing my makeup if I am only wearing BB cream. However, when I am wearing a full face of makeup, set and not set, this barely removes the top layer. In general, this is good at removing light products such as lotions or sunscreens but when it comes to makeup it is not of much use.

       "903    I am in my 60s so fairly experienced with putting on eyeliner.  I liked the applicator on this product because I could draw on a very thin line.  As a woman of a certain age, I want an understated look.  I thought I had hit the jackpot when I first looked in the mirror after putting this eyeliner on.  I had managed a thin line that complemented my eyes.  I was very pleased and got myself together to leave for the store.  Thanks heavens I looked in the hallway mirror before I went out the door because my eyes were definitely not understated at that point.  In just a little while I had gone from looking nice to looking like I was going to either a Halloween party or a Goth festival.  The liner had faded around my lash line but spread to my upper lids and under my eyes.  I don't have oily lids and I had put on a primer with a light tan eyeshadow.  I have never had a liner run this bad, especially in the time it took for me to go from upstairs to downstairs, feed the dog, and put on my coat.  I know most of the reviews on this product are positive but my experience definitely wasn't.  I don't know why, I just know that this was the worst eyeliner experience I have had since I started wearing makeup in my teens.  I did try using it again but had pretty much the same experience so tossed it.  I now use Physician's Formula Eye Booster 2 in 1.  It has a perfectly controllable and thin brush that allows me to get close to my eyelids and it lasts the entire day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "905    This eyeliner works well for the first couple days...before you have to sharpen it. After that, it is absolutely impossible to sharpen. Total waste of money. Every time I sharpen it with my nice make-up sharpener, it takes big clumps of the eyeliner off and it’s so soft that it just crumbles.  It’s like you’re just throwing away expensive eyeliner because when you sharpen it keeps breaking off and it’s sad to see it in your trashcan instead of on your eyes . Have to remember not to get this one again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "906    I should have read the reviews before buying this.  Once you've used the pencil down to where you need to either use a sharpener or screw the bottom to expose more liner, it's done - there is no more liner.  You've got to throw it away after that because there isn't a way to sharpen or to twist the bottom for more liner.  It's great otherwise.  I guess this is how this make-up company is providing less product for just as much money.  Hopefully it backfires on them when people stop buying it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "907    I purchased always pearly pink and after having it closed for a few days I opened it to find a weird pink dye coming out of the shadow.

Not a surprise, it's a common reaction for me.  So I went to Sephora and asked the make-up expert for a product like this.  They looked at the ingredients in horror, \"Girl, there are some things in here you should never put on your skin no matter your sensitivity.\"  Unfortunately I didn't think in the moment to ask which ingredients those were, but I went with a more natural brand and I haven't broken out since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

Ridiculous!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "2367   Total rip off! The pump stops working when there's at least half a bottle left.  Had ordered 2 bottles. Tried second bottle & same thing.  They sent me another bottle and guess what!!! Duh! I'll have to take the hammer to the top & put it in a sealable baggie. I even called the company about 2 years ago,  as I like the product. The makeup foundation is just right for older skin. Doesn't look masky or get creasy as you see on so many older women. They NEED to fix the packaging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "3765   This product has a pronounced cooling sensation as soon as it hits your lips, feeling like you're putting something on there that shouldn't be used on the skin. It's a thin liquid and doesn't set right away, although the pigmentation is bright. I just can't get over the bizarre, chemical sensation on my lips and have to toss this. I have had similarly unpleasant experiences with L'Oreal's Pro Matte Lip Gloss and Maybelline's Vivid Matte Liquid, which both caused a weird numbing sensation. The only drugstore liquid lip formulas that so far get my seal of approval are by NYX and Wet'n'Wild, because they don't feel cooling or numbing when you put them on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "4284   Very strange. I've worn this exact mascara for many years, but the ones I ordered from amazon seemed totally different.Almost as if they were OLD. The product was very thick and clumped-up even on my first application.It made me re-think purchasing L'Oreal mascara altogether!I can't stand the fact that it's the ONE cosmetic I MUST use, so I try and make certain it is of a good quality...Once I spent several minutes DE-clumping, it wasn't halfway through my work day when I noticed \"racoon eyes\" on both the upper and lower areas of my eye area.Terrible!!!UPDATE May, 23 2018---I gave this seller ONE MORE TRY, after they contacted me to \"assure\" me the product was not old.Ladies, PLEASE trust me with this... I've been purchasing the SAME product for over 20 years, and I have never had anything close to a BAD experience as I have had buying through Amazon.As far as I'm concerned I feel as though they should credit my account for the 4 tubes I have struggled with upon the FIRST APPLICATION!!!(If they do not, I will make certain my review is seen by ALL who read these reviews.

       "4286   I bought this mascara in black and loved it---finished it and needed  a new tube.  I bough the mystic black because it was $1 cheaper--and I wanted to see if was darker or lighter than the regular black.  This formula is completely different---it gets everywhere all over my eyelid which the first tube never did.  Also it smudges and creates raccoon eyes within a few hours of wear.  It terrible to have black smudges everywhere.  I like the mascara---I just dont recommend the mystic black.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

I guess they don't care.EDIT: I was finally able to speak to someone. After all that pain and stress and worry about glass in my eye, all they're doing is refunding my $11.58. Unbelievable.

       "8369   I tried the whole line of Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Loreal and was excited to see if it lived up to its claim of reducing fine lines and wrinkles. It said nothing about my other skin problems (large pores, oily skin, acne) but figured it might help with the wrinkles. I was able to try these products for free from Loreal and I did so for two weeks. My first impression was not good. The products seemed to make my skin more red than usual and left a sticky, tacky feel behind. I figured the redness was because it was new and my skin would need to adjust. This did not go away as time progressed however and actually got worse as I started breaking out pretty bad from the products. I pushed through though since I wanted to give it a full two weeks but at the end nothing changed and I was still red and acne ridden. Also, I do not feel it did anything for my wrinkles. The product claims that within 1-2 weeks you would notice a change in fine lines and wrinkles but I did not. My face remained the same for those two issues. As far as the brightness part of the product I can't really write to that. My skin doesn't have dullness and is always bright and shiny with oil so I'm probably the wrong person for that aspect of this product line. Overall I would definitely not recommend this product line to anyone with oily or acne prone skin. If you have rosacea you will become more red most likely so stay away if you have that too. I went back in my normal routine after two weeks of using the Loreal line and my skin is back to normal with minimal redness and acne.  For the astringent pads in particular I did not like anything about them. They left my face feeling sticky and didn't seem to really do anything or my skin. They do contain alcohol denat. which could be the main culprit of making my skin so red and acne ridden. I'm not sure if it was one or all products that caused redness so that is why I am rating this product so low. In the pictures the before is on the right and bottom of the comparison shots.   \n",
       "8370   Although the toner is described as alcohol free, my eyes got irritated badly. So I checked the ingredients, and found that the third ingredient is \"ALCOHOL DENAT\", which means denatured alcohol. According to wikipedia, \"It is often used as an antiseptic for minor wounds, although this practice is harmful and counterproductive, since it kills skin cells.\"Also, it is marked \"99% Alcohol-Free\" on the back of the bottle. Since the main ingredient of all toners is water, the so-called \"alcohol-free\" is just meaningless. It seems that the toner's description is quite deceptive.Canceled the subscription and will never buy it again. Wish I would have checked the ingredients first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8371   Just purchased L'Oreal Age Perfect Day 2.5 oz, but cannot wear it because of the perfume, which smells like insecticide, and the smell stays with you for many hours. Otherwise product seems to perform well. I do use their Revitalift series, where the perfume is mild, not this type of grassy scent, and would use this one if it came in a non-perfumed version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "9003   This product has mineral oil (liquid petroleum) in it.  You would think that a global skincare company such as L'Oréal would keep this ingredient out of its products.  Mineral oil just \"sits\" on the skin . . . not very nutritious. And while sitting on the skin it holds in bacteria.  Mineral oil is a contaminant of the human body and can clog pores.  Many skincare companies avoid using this ingredient in their products.  There are many other manufacturers out there who address updated skincare technology using natural plant extracts, natural oils and other ingredients which have benefits for our skin. I will not be using the rest of this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "9004   I’d give it ZERO if I could. This isn’t the same product sold in stores. It’s a knock off. Don’t waste your money!  The store version is thick. This is watery. The store brand is the proper color. This turns orange.

       "9005   I doubt this is an authentic product. I have never seen L'Oréal seal their merchandise with scotch tape, and the box was clearly opened before it got to me. The little plastic disc that usually covers the jar opening to keep the cream out of the lid was missing.  I don't think I'll be putting this on my face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "11562  I am using this cream each month, for very long time and when bought this one from Amazon, noticed that it was was totally different cream! (i attached the photos) Totally disappointed! Smells not like original, the lid is different color from the original one, original has white lid on top, the texture of the cream is different! If you are thinking to buy it, my suggestion is don’t. As we don't know where this item was made...Better to find really original product. This is my 2 cents :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "11563  I have a genuine version of this product purchased directly from L'oreal. I compared it to the one I received. First, the handle is half an inch longer on the Amazon product, and L'oreal didn't change their packaging.  Then the Amazon product dries quicker and slightly more orange. The Amazon product also burns on the skin a bit.  Oh, and the coup de gras, no one who receives this item receives it sealed. The packaging alone is cause for authenticity concern. Combined with the rest , you would be better off buying somewhere else. I will be reporting this counterfeit product to Amazon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "11564  I usually go into these reviews with at least a partial sense that I am subject to committing user error. In this case, I can't lay fault completely to the product, but I will say that the biggest problems were not caused by me.First, the product does not anywhere say that someone with light skin couldn't not use it. As it is the medium and not the dark, I thought I was safe. Wrong.Next, it doesn't have any suggestions for HOW to apply the color. That would be helpful. I read around that I should use circular motions, and when I got to it, I forgot and didn't at all. That was definitely my fault. Straight up and down motions cause streaks. And boy did I get streaks.The worst part is that I am seriously orange. And the box says you will see results within \"less than an hour.\" No way. When I went to bed (read: when I might have still had some time to correct things) it all looked good aside from one streak on my thigh. When I woke up I seriously gasped! My feet are orange, my legs are orange and streaky, and I still smell HORRIBLE from the \"citrus scent,\" which is actually only citrus when you are first putting it on. Now about 12 hours later I am still smelling like self tanner and I am lucky I don't have to leave the house today.I didn't purchase this from amazon, but felt that I'd like to share the review for those (like me) that come here first to check things out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "11565  This is a FAKE. This is NOT the real product. I own the real, authentic L'Oreal True Match Super-Blendable Concealer in Cool (C1-2-3) and I've attached a picture of it here, to compare against these ones that I got from Amazon that are clearly FAKE. The real concealer has a shorter cap, is more pink-toned in color and it doesn't oxidize at all, and has a slightly longer, thicker, and definitely nicer brush (in the brush-tip applicator). The fake ones the I got from Amazon have a significantly longer cap, are more yellow-toned in color which does oxidize and get darker, and the brush is sh*tty and cheap, and messed up.Just look at the photos! In the photos, the authentic L'Oreal True Match Super-Blendable Concealer is the one on the LEFT, whereas the fake ones from Amazon are the two tall ones next to it - the center one and the right one. In the arm swatch photo, the TOP swatch is the one of the genuine L'Oreal True Match Super-Blendable Concealer, and the other two below it - the middle one and the bottom one - are the fakes from Amazon.I am going to be contacting Amazon about this. Do NOT purchase these. They are nothing like the authentic, genuine product and you will not get the same results from them. Save your time and money, and just go to Target or CVS to buy the real thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "11566  I used to have the old version of this container with a different applicator. The consistency of the concealer seems very thin compared to that of the old container, and the applicator has changed from a blotter/dabber to a brush. The new container doesn't contain the concealer. It is EVERYWHERE. It is oozing out of the lid every time I open and close the bottle. If I don't store it upright (like when I am traveling) it is even worse. The concealer itself doesn't seem as good, its thinner in color and not as dense with easy coverage. I am disappointed because I wear the Fair/Cool color and there's not much else out there that matches as well in color as this does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "12399  I really, really, dislike this product!!! I have fairly normal, somewhat sensitive skin and this did exactly what one or should I say, I expect. I tried this on clean showered skin and my face instantly felt VERY DRY, tight, and downright uncomfortable! I don’t know about anyone else but I expect hyaluronic to be moisturizing, not drying, given that it holds a thousand times it’s weight in water and is supposed to draw moisture to the skin... using this once was more than ENOUGH! I’ve been using Netrogena hyaluronic gel-cream for a very long time and absolutely adore it but thought I’d try this to see if there was any chance it was superior and it’s an obvious outcome. I’ll be returning or this will go straight to the TRASH! There’s my two cents. Hope it helps anyone avoid my mistake.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
